Anathema his doctrine which rests: its trust on the Sevenfold!  Cursed be he who reproaches his Creator: and ascribes dominion to the Seven!  Cursed be he who reads the Scriptures: and becomes a gainsayer of the Scriptures!  Cursed be he who reads the Prophets: and breaks the words of the Prophets!  Cursed be he who reads the Apostles: and abides not by their words!\"  To this is subjoined a verse, the response of Balai (Balaeus) a disciple:—  \"The Lord exalt thy horn: O Church that art faithful!

					},
					{
						"text": "He wrote in the metres of the heathen classics; and it was not until a later day, and from the hands of other writers, working on other lines, that the hymns appeared which won their way into the Greek ritual,—hymns written in rhythmic prose, in what seems to be conscious imitation of the Syriac model."
					},
					{
						"text": "The imitation, however, is by no means complete; it is apparent in the general tone and manner, but does not extend to the form: just as the Greek version of Ephraim's Hymns, though faithfully reproducing his thoughts and literary method, makes no attempt to retain his metrical system; but is a rendering into what in form is prose of an original which is in verse."

					},
					{
						"text": "The Syriac Hymnody is constructed on the Hebrew principle of parallelism, in which thought answers to thought in clauses of repetitive or antithetical balance: but, unlike the Hebrew, its clauses are further regulated by strict equivalence of syllabic measure."
					},
					{
						"text": "But though in this latter respect it seems to approach to the forms of Western verse, ancient or modern, yet the resemblance is but superficial: Syriac verse is not measured by feet—whether determined by syllable quantity, as in Greek and Latin, or by accent, as in English and other modern languages."
					},
					{
						"text": "Thus the metre of Syriac poetry is substantially the \"thought-metre\" (as it has been well called) of Hebrew, reduced to regularity of form by the rule that each of the lines into which the balanced clauses fall, shall consist of a fixed number of syllables."
					},
					{
						"text": "There is no systematic rhyme; but the nature of the language which by reason of its uniformity of etymological structure abounds in words of like terminations, often causes correspondences of sound amounting to rhyme, or at least to assonance."
					},
					{
						"text": "The lines are very short; not exceeding twelve syllables, sometimes confined to four."
					},
					{
						"text": "Ephraim, though not the actual inventor, was the first master of this metrical system, the first to develop it into system and variety."
					},
					{
						"text": "His favorite metres are the five-syllabled and the seven-syllabled."
					},
					{
						"text": "In his more elaborate poems, such as the Nisibene series, which are rather Odes than Hymns, the strophes or stanzas into which the lines are arranged are often long and of complicated structure, each strophe consisting of many lines (ranging from four up to fourteen or more) of various lengths according to a fixed scheme rigidly adhered to throughout the poem—sometimes throughout a group of cognate poems."
					},
					{
						"text": "In other poems, especially in Hymns intended for popular or ecclesiastical use, where simplicity of structure is suitable, the lines which compose each strophe, whatever their number, are of uniform length."
					},
					{
						"text": "So easily do the Syriac tongue, and the genius of Syriac literature, lend themselves to this scheme of short, syllabically equal clauses, that (as has been already stated) many even of the Homilies are metrical; arranged not indeed in strophes, but in continuous succession of brief stichoi, all of one and the same length—usually of seven syllables; a sort of blank verse, but a blank verse with no animating accents, no varying pauses."
					},
					{
						"text": "A Homily so constructed would fatigue the ear of a modern audience by its monotony: but inasmuch as some portions of Ephraim's Homilies were used in certain ecclesiastical Offices, probably recited in a sort of chant, it may be that in such use we have the explanation of their quasi-versified structure."
					},
					{
						"text": "In point of literary value as poems, a high place cannot be claimed for these Hymns."
					},
					{
						"text": "Some of them indeed have much of the devotional fervor, and not a little of the human pathos, of the Psalms of David: others show something of the antithetic point and epigrammatic terseness of the Proverbs of Solomon."
					},
					{
						"text": "Yet the devout aspirations and confessions of the poet are too often forced and artificial in their utterance; in his funeral dirges we seem here and there to detect the false note of the professional mourner in the effort to exhaust all possible topics of grief; in all his poems he tends to prolong the series of his parallelisms to a wearisome length and with an iteration that, though laboriously varied, is tedious,—an iteration that has no precedent in the poetry of the Old Testament, save in one or two of the latest Psalms, such as the CXXXVIth with its recurring burden \"For His mercy endureth for ever,\" or the CXIXth with its artificial arrangement (often emulated in Syriac Hymnody) by which each of the twenty-two letters of the alphabet in turn is made to head each one of eight consecutive verses in praise of the Law of the Lord."
					},
					{
						"text": "On the whole, it must be admitted that the greater qualities of poetry, such as abound everywhere in nearly every writer of the Hebrew Scriptures,—of truth in rendering the inmost feelings of man's heart in words of absolute simplicity, of aspiration that rises without effort to the highest things of God—to these Ephraim's Hymns have no claim."
					},
					{
						"text": "For these shortcomings in his poetry, two main causes may be assigned."
					},
					{
						"text": "One is in the man himself,—or rather, in his mode of life."
					},
					{
						"text": "Naturally, he was prone to feel for and with his fellow-men; for the sorrows of the bereaved, the cares of the toiling poor whose lot (as he proved in the last and best episode of his history) moved him to sympathy and active succour."
					},
					{
						"text": "He can be simple accordingly when he deals with the homely facts of life."
					},
					{
						"text": "But the main tenor of his course was ascetic; he looked on this life and the life beyond—on man and to God—with a vision clouded by the gloom of unnatural solitude and self-mortification."
					},
					{
						"text": "An assiduous student of Scripture, he had an ear for its threatenings rather than its promises and consolations; dread and dismay entered into his heart more deeply than hope; the \"Stand in awe and sin not\" of the Psalmist was more familiar to his spirit than the \"Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "The perpetual proneness to tears on which his biographers dwell with admiration, and which he seems to have thought it right to foster, has its reflex in his writings, in the hysterical overflow of his fears, his lamentations and his self-reproach."
					},
					{
						"text": "He had lived as an anchorite till his nature became morbid, and its moral fibre was weakened."
					},
					{
						"text": "But to reach the highest levels in religious literature, whether in prose or in poetry, a man must be sane, his mind healthy and strong,—with a health and strength sustained and exercised by wholesome daily contact with the lives of other men."
					},
					{
						"text": "The second cause is to be found in the method, above described as his—developed though not actually invented by him, and made his own—which he chose as the vehicle of his thoughts and emotions."
					},
					{
						"text": "The \"thought-metre\" of the Hebrew poets was regulated (as we have seen) by balance of sense, not of sound—member answering to member, verse by verse, in equivalence or contrast of substance merely, not of verbal form: and in this metre, which has been happily likened to the alternating beat of a bird's wings as it mounts aloft, they had shown it to be possible to attain the highest reach of sublime expression of the utmost that man's spirit can conceive of God and Heaven."
					},
					{
						"text": "The Syriac Hymnists had the unhappy idea of effecting a compromise between their two contrasted models, the Hebrew and the Greek; and to this end they compelled their verses into conformity by syllabic measure, of sound, as well as of sense."
					},
					{
						"text": "This artificial structure has an effectiveness of its own, and is suited to the popular ear; but it is incapable of the elevation which the earlier and simpler method attained without effort."
					},
					{
						"text": "As its Semitic parallelism of substance excluded Syriac poetry from the variety in topic and largeness in conception of the Greek, so this grecized regularity of form hampered its efforts to rise to the upper regions where the Hebrew is at home."
					},
					{
						"text": "The wings are free and ample by whose regulated stroke Hebrew poetry is borne, and they carry it to the supreme height: in Syriac poetry the flight is too commonly low and feeble, because its wings are clipped."

					},
					{
						"text": "So then, before He was crucified, He gave the deaf the power of hearing, that after He was crucified, all ears should hear and believe in His resurrection."

					{
						"text": "Our Redeemer was in every way equipped, that in every way He might rescue us from our captor."

						"text": "14."
					},
					{
						"text": "Now our Lord bestowed great gifts through small means; that He might teach us of what they are deprived who have scorned great things."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if from the hem of His garment, healing like this was secretly stolen, could He not assuredly heal when His word distinctly granted healing?  And if defiled lips were sanctified by kissing His feet, how much more should not pure lips be sanctified by kissing His mouth?  For the sinful woman by her kisses received the grace of His sacred feet, which had come with toil to bring her remission of her sins."
					},
					{
						"text": "She was refreshing the feet of her Healer with oil freely, for freely had He brought her the treasure of healing for her sickness."
					},
					{
						"text": "For it was not for the sake of his stomach that He Who satisfies the hungry was a guest; but for the sake of the sinful woman's repentance He Who justifies sinners made Himself a guest."
					},
					{
						"text": "15."
					},
					{
						"text": "For it was not for the dainties of the Pharisees that our Lord hungered, but for the tears of the sinful woman He was an hungered."
					},
					{
						"text": "For when He was satisfied and refreshed by the tears for which He hungered, He turned and rebuked him who had bidden Him to the food that passes away, that He might show that it was not for the sake of food for the body that He had become a guest, but for the sake of help to the soul."
					},
					{
						"text": "For it was not for the sake of pleasure that our Lord mingled with gluttonous men and winebibbers, as the Pharisee supposed; but that in their food as mortals He might mingle for them His teaching as the medicine of life."
					},
					{
						"text": "For even as it was in the matter of eating that the Evil One gave his deadly counsel to Adam and his helpmeet, so in the matter of eating the Good Lord gave His life-giving counsel to the sons of Adam."
					},
					{
						"text": "For He was the fisherman Who came down to fish for the lives of the lost."
					},
					{

						"text": "Yet he by his great dainties displayed the smallness of his love to our Lord; but she by her tears displayed the greatness of her love to our Lord."
					},
					{
						"text": "Thus he that had invited Him to the great banquet was rebuked because of the smallness of his love; but she by her few tears atoned for the many follies of her offences."
					},
					{
						"text": "Simon the Pharisee received our Lord as a prophet; because of the signs, and not because of faith."
					},
					{
						"text": "For he was a son of Israel, who when signs drew near, himself also drew near to the Lord of the signs; and when the signs ceased, he also stood naked without faith."
					},
					{
						"text": "This man also when he saw our Lord with signs, esteemed Him as a prophet; but when our Lord ceased from signs, the doubting mind of the sons of his people entered him."
					},
					{
						"text": "This man if He had been a prophet, He would have known that this woman is a sinner."
					},

For since Paul might have been injured by the vehemence of this sun to which he was accustomed, if he gazed upon it not according to custom, how much more should he be injured by the glory of that light to which his eyes never had been accustomed?  For behold, Daniel also was melted and poured out on every side before the glory of the angel, whose vehement brightness suddenly shone upon him! and it was not because of the angel's wrath that his human weakness was melted, just as it is not on account of the wrath or hostility of fire that wax is melted before it; but on account of the weakness of the wax it cannot keep firm and stand in presence of fire."

But if mercy is that which shows mercy to all, well did Simeon call our Lord by the name of the mercy that showed mercy to him,—Him Who freed him from the world which is full of snares, that he might go to Eden which is full of pleasures; for he who was priest said and testified that he was offered as an offering, that from the midst of the perishing world he should go and be stored up in the treasure-house which is kept safe."

So, then, the keys which He had received from Simeon the priest, them He gave to another Simeon the Apostle; that even though the People had not hearkened to the former Simeon, the Gentiles might hearken to the latter Simeon."

					{
						"text": "I have received thy letter, my beloved, and when I read it, it greatly gladdened me that thou hast turned thy thoughts to these investigations."
					},
					{
						"text": "For this thing that thou hast asked of me shall be freely granted, for freely it was received."
					},
					{
						"text": "And whosoever has, and desires to withhold from him that seeks, whatsoever he withholds shall be taken away from him."
					},
					{
						"text": "Whoever of free grace receives, of free grace also does it behove him to give."
					},
					{
						"text": "And so, my beloved, as to that which thou hast asked of me, so far as my insignificance has apprehended, I will write to thee."
					},
					{
						"text": "And also whatsoever thou hast not sought of me, invoking God, I will explain to thee."
					},
					{
						"text": "Hear then, my beloved, and open the inward ears of thy heart unto me, and the spiritual perceptions of thy mind to that which I say unto thee."
					},
					{
						"text": "2."
					},
					{
						"text": "Faith is compounded of many things, and by many kinds is it brought to perfection."
					},
					{
						"text": "For it is like a building that is built up of many pieces of workmanship and so its edifice rises to the top."
					},
					{
						"text": "And know, my beloved, that in the foundations of the building stones are laid, and so resting upon stones the whole edifice rises until it is perfected."
					},
					{
						"text": "Thus also the true Stone, our Lord Jesus Christ, is the foundation of all our faith."
					},
					{
						"text": "And on Him, on [this] Stone faith is based."
					},
					{
						"text": "And resting on faith all the structure rises until it is completed."
					},
					{
						"text": "For it is the foundation that is the beginning of all the building."
					},
					{
						"text": "For when any one is brought nigh unto faith, it is laid for him upon the Stone, that is our Lord Jesus Christ."
					},
					{
						"text": "And his building cannot be shaken by the waves, nor can it be injured by the winds."
					},
					{
						"text": "By the stormy blasts it does not fall, because its structure is reared upon the rock of the true Stone."
					},
					{
						"text": "And in this that I have called Christ the Stone, I have not spoken of my own thought, but the Prophets beforehand called Him the Stone."
					},
					{
						"text": "And this I shall make clear to thee."
					},
					{
						"text": "3."
					},
					{
						"text": "And now hear concerning faith that is based upon the Stone, and concerning the structure that is reared up upon the Stone."
					},
					{
						"text": "For first a man believes, and when he believes, he loves."
					},
					{
						"text": "When he loves, he hopes."
					},
					{
						"text": "When he hopes, he is justified."
					},
					{
						"text": "When he is justified, he is perfected."
					},
					{
						"text": "When he is perfected, he is consummated."
					},
					{
						"text": "And when his whole structure is raised up, consummated, and perfected, then he becomes a house and a temple for a dwelling-place of Christ, as Jeremiah the Prophet said:—The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord are ye, if ye amend your ways and your works."
					},
					{
						"text": "And again He said through the Prophet:—I will dwell in them and walk in them."
					},
					{
						"text": "And also the Blessed Apostle thus said:—Ye are the temple of God and the spirit of Christ dwelleth in you."
					},
					{
						"text": "And also our Lord again thus said to His disciples:—Ye are in Me and I am in you."
					},
					{
						"text": "4."
					},
					{
						"text": "And when the house has become a dwelling-place, then the man begins to be anxious as to that which is required for Him Who dwells in the building."
					},
					{
						"text": "Just as if a king or an honourable man, to whom a royal name is given, should lodge in the house, there would be required for the King all the appurtenances of royalty and all the service that is needed for the King's honour."
					},
					{
						"text": "For in a house that is void of all good things, the King will not lodge, nor will he dwell in the midst of it; but all that is choicest in the house is required for the King and that nothing in it be deficient."
					},
					{
						"text": "And if anything be deficient there in the house in which the King lodges, the keeper of the house is delivered over to death, because he did not make ready the service for the King."
					},
					{
						"text": "So also let the man, who becomes a house, yea a dwelling-place, for Christ, take heed to what is needed for the service of Christ, Who lodges in him, and with what things he may please Him."
					},
					{
						"text": "For first he builds his building on the Stone, which is Christ."
					},
					{
						"text": "On Him, on the Stone, is faith based, and on faith is reared up all the structure."
					},
					{
						"text": "For the habitation of the house is required pure fasting, and it is made firm by faith."
					},
					{
						"text": "There is also needed for it pure prayer, and through faith is it accepted."
					},
					{
						"text": "Necessary for it too is love, and with faith is it compounded."
					},
					{
						"text": "Furthermore alms are needed, and through faith are they given."
					},
					{
						"text": "He demands also meekness, and by faith is it adorned."
					},
					{
						"text": "He chooses too virginity, and by faith is it loved."
					},
					{
						"text": "He joins with himself holiness, and in faith is it planted."
					},
					{
						"text": "He cares also for wisdom, and through faith is it acquired."
					},
					{
						"text": "He desires also hospitality, and by faith does it abound."
					},
					{
						"text": "Requisite for Him also is simplicity, and with faith is it commingled."
					},
					{
						"text": "He demands patience also, and by faith is it perfected."
					},
					{
						"text": "He has respect also to long-suffering, and through faith is it acquired."
					},
					{
						"text": "He loves mourning also, and through faith is it manifested."
					},
					{
						"text": "He seeks also for purity, and by faith is it preserved."
					},
					{
						"text": "All these things does the faith demand that is based on the rock of the true Stone, that is Christ."
					},
					{
						"text": "These works are required for Christ the King, Who dwells in men that are built up in these works."
					},
					{
						"text": "5."
					},
					{
						"text": "And if perchance thou shouldest say:—If Christ is set for the foundation, how does Christ also dwell in the building when it is completed?  For both these things did the blessed Apostle say."
					},
					{
						"text": "For he said:—I as a wise architect have laid the foundation."
					},
					{
						"text": "And there he defined the foundation and made it clear, for he said as follows:—No man can lay other foundation than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ."
					},
					{
						"text": "And that Christ furthermore dwells in that building is the word that was written above—that of Jeremiah who called men temples and said of God that He dwelt in them."
					},
					{
						"text": "And the Apostle said:—The Spirit of Christ dwelleth in you."
					},
					{
						"text": "And our Lord said:—I and My Father are one."
					},
					{
						"text": "And therefore that word is accomplished, that Christ dwells in men, namely, in those who believe on Him, and He is the foundation on which is reared up the whole building."
					},
					{
						"text": "6."
					},
					{
						"text": "But I must proceed to my former statement that Christ is called the Stone in the Prophets."
					},
					{
						"text": "For in ancient times David said concerning Him:—The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the building."
					},
					{
						"text": "And how did the builders reject this Stone which is Christ?  How else than that they so rejected Him before Pilate and said—This man shall not be King over us."
					},
					{
						"text": "And again in that parable that our Lord spake that a certain nobleman went to receive kingly power and to return and rule over them; and they sent after Him envoys saying:—This man shall not be King over us."
					},
					{
						"text": "By these things they rejected the Stone which is Christ."
					},
					{
						"text": "And how did it become the head of the building?  How else than that it was set up over the building of the Gentiles and upon it is reared up all their building."
					},
					{
						"text": "And who are the builders?  Who but the priests and Pharisees who did not build a sure building, but were overthrowing everything that he was building, as is written in Ezekiel the Prophet:—He was building a wall of partition, but they were shaking it, that it might fall."
					},
					{
						"text": "And again it is written:—I sought amongst them a man who was closing the fence and standing in the breach over the face of the land, that I might not destroy it and I did not find."
					},
					{
						"text": "And furthermore Isaiah also prophesied beforehand with regard to this stone."
					},
					{
						"text": "For he said:—Thus saith the Lord, Behold I lay in Zion a chosen stone in the precious corner, the heart of the wall of the foundation."
					},
					{
						"text": "And he said again there:—Every one that believeth on it shall not fear."
					},
					{
						"text": "And whosoever falleth on that stone shall be broken, and every one on whom it shall fall, it will crush."
					},
					{
						"text": "For the people of the house of Israel fell upon Him, and He became their destruction for ever."
					},
					{
						"text": "And again it shall fall on the image and crush it."
					},
					{
						"text": "And the Gentiles believed on it and do not fear."
					},
					{
						"text": "7."
					},
					{
						"text": "And He shows thus with regard to that stone that it was laid as head of the wall and as foundation."
					},
					{
						"text": "But if that stone was laid as the foundation, how did it also become the head of the wall?  How but that when our Lord came, He laid His faith in the earth like a foundation, and it rose above all the heavens like the head of the wall and all the building was finished with the stones, from the bottom to the top."
					},
					{
						"text": "And with regard to the faith about which I said that He laid His faith in the earth, this David proclaimed beforehand about Christ."
					},
					{
						"text": "For He said:—Faith shall spring up from the earth."
					},
					{
						"text": "And that again, it is above, he said:—Righteousness looked down from the heavens."
					},
					{
						"text": "8."
					},
					{
						"text": "And again Daniel also spoke concerning this stone which is Christ."
					},
					{
						"text": "For he said:—The stone was cut out from the mountain, not by hands, and it smote the image, and the whole earth was filled with it."
					},
					{
						"text": "This he showed beforehand with regard to Christ that the whole earth shall be filled with Him."
					},
					{
						"text": "For lo! by the faith of Christ are all the ends of the earth filled, as David said:—The sound of the Gospel of Christ has gone forth into all the earth."
					},
					{
						"text": "And again when He sent forth His apostles He spake thus to them:—Go forth, make disciples of all nations and they will believe on Me."
					},
					{
						"text": "And again the Prophet Zechariah also prophesied about that stone which is Christ."
					},
					{
						"text": "For he said:—I saw a chief stone of equality and of love."
					},
					{
						"text": "And why did he say \"chief\"?  Surely because from the beginning He was with His Father."
					},
					{
						"text": "And again that he spoke of love, it was because when He came into the world, He said thus to His disciples:—This is My commandment, that ye love one another."
					},
					{
						"text": "And again He said:—I have called you My friends (lovers)."
					},
					{
						"text": "And the blessed Apostle said thus:—God loved as in the love of His Son."
					},
					{
						"text": "Of a truth Christ loved us and gave Himself for us."
					},
					{
						"text": "9."
					},
					{
						"text": "And definitely did He show concerning this stone:—Lo! on this stone will I open seven eyes."
					},
					{
						"text": "And what then are the seven eyes that were opened on the stone?  Clearly the Spirit of God that abode on Christ with seven operations, as Isaiah the Prophet said:—The Spirit of God shall rest and dwell upon Him, (a spirit) of wisdom and understanding, of counsel and of courage, of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord."
					},
					{
						"text": "These were the seven eyes that were opened upon the Stone, and these are the seven eyes of the Lord which look upon all the earth."
					},
					{
						"text": "10."
					},
					{
						"text": "And also with reference to Christ was this (which follows) said."
					},
					{
						"text": "For he said that He was given as a light to all the Gentiles as the Prophet Isaiah said:—I have given Thee as a light to all the Gentiles, that Thou shouldest be My redemption to the ends of the earth."
					},
					{
						"text": "And furthermore David also said;—Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my paths."
					},
					{
						"text": "And also the word and discourse of the Lord is Christ, as is written in the beginning of the Gospel of our Saviour:—In the beginning was the Word."
					},
					{
						"text": "And with regard to the light there again he bore witness:—The light was shining in the darkness and the darkness comprehended it not."
					},
					{
						"text": "What then is this:—The light was shining in the darkness and the darkness comprehended it not?  Clearly Christ, Whose light shone in the midst of the people of the house of Israel, and the people of the house of Israel did not comprehend the light of Christ, in that they did not believe on Him, as it is written:—He came unto His own, and His own received Him not."
					},
					{
						"text": "And also our Lord Jesus called them darkness, for He said to His disciples;—Whatsoever I say unto you in the darkness, that speak ye in the light, namely, let your light shine among the Gentiles;because they received the light of Christ, Who is the Light of the Gentiles."
					},
					{
						"text": "And He said again to His Apostles:—Ye are the light of the world."
					},
					{
						"text": "And again He said unto them;—Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in heaven."
					},
					{
						"text": "And again He showed with regard to Himself that He is the light, for He said to His disciples:—Walk while the light is with you, ere the darkness overtake you."
					},
					{
						"text": "And again He said to them:—Believe on the light that ye may be children of light."
					},
					{
						"text": "And again He said:—I am the light of the world."
					},
					{
						"text": "And again He said:—No man lighteth a lamp and putteth it under a bushel or under a bed, or putteth it in a hidden place, but putteth it upon the lamp-stand that every one may see the light of the lamp."
					},
					{
						"text": "And the shining lamp is Christ, as David said;—Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light to my paths."
					},
					{
						"text": "11."
					},
					{
						"text": "And furthermore the Prophet Hosea also said:—Light you a lamp and seek ye the Lord."
					},
					{
						"text": "And our Lord Jesus Christ said:—What woman is there who has ten drachmos and shall lose one of them, and will not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek her drachma that she lost?  What then does this woman signify?  Clearly the congregation of the house of Israel, to which the ten commandments were given."
					},
					{
						"text": "They lost the first commandment—that in which He warned them saying:—I am the Lord your God, Who brought you up from the land of Egypt."
					},
					{
						"text": "And when they had lost this first commandment, also the nine which are after it they could not keep, because on the first depend the nine."
					},
					{
						"text": "For it was an impossibility that while worshipping Baal, they should keep the nine commandments."
					},
					{
						"text": "For they lost the first commandment, like that woman who lost one drachma from the ten."
					},
					{
						"text": "So the Prophet cried unto them:—Light you a lamp and seek ye the Lord."
					},
					{
						"text": "And furthermore the Prophet Isaiah also said:—Seek ye the Lord and when ye shall have found Him, call upon Him; and when He is near let the sinner abandon his way and the wicked man his thought."
					},
					{
						"text": "For that lamp shone and they did not by it seek the Lord their God."
					},
					{
						"text": "And its light shone in the darkness and the darkness did not comprehend it."
					},
					{
						"text": "And the lamp was set up on the lamp-stand and those who were in the house did not see its light."
					},
					{
						"text": "And what then means this, that the lamp was set up on the lamp-stand?  Clearly His being raised up upon the cross."
					},
					{
						"text": "And by this all the house was made dark over them."
					},
					{
						"text": "For when they crucified Him, the light was darkened from them, and shone amongst the Gentiles, because that from the time of the sixth hour (of the day) on which they crucified Him even unto the ninth hour there was darkness in all the land of Israel."
					},
					{
						"text": "And the sun set in midday and the land was darkened in the shining daytime, as is written in Zechariah the Prophet:—It shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, I will cause the sun to set in midday, and will make dark the land in the shining daytime."
					},
					{
						"text": "12."
					},
					{
						"text": "Now I must proceed to my former subject of faith, that on it are reared up all the good works of the building."
					},
					{
						"text": "And again, in what I said with regard to the building, it was in no strange fashion that I spoke, but the blessed Apostle wrote in the first Epistle to the Corinthians, saying;—I as a wise master-builder have laid the foundation, but every one buildeth on it."
					},
					{
						"text": "One builds silver and gold and goodly stones; another builds reed and straw and stubble."
					},
					{
						"text": "In the last day that building shall be tried by fire; for the gold and silver and goodly stones shall be preserved in the midst of the fire, because they are a firm building."
					},
					{
						"text": "But as for the straw and reed and stubble, the fire shall have power upon them and they shall be burned."
					},
					{
						"text": "And what is the gold and silver and goodly stones by which the building is raised up?  Clearly the good deeds of faith, which shall be preserved in the midst of the fire; because Christ dwells in that secure building, and He is its preserver from the fire."
					},
					{
						"text": "And let us consider and understand (this) from the example that God has given us also in the former dispensation, because the promises of that dispensation will abide sure for us."
					},
					{
						"text": "Let us then understand from (the case of) those three righteous men who were cast into the midst of the fire and were not burned, namely, Hananiah, Azariah and Misael, over whom the fire had no power, because they built a secure building and rejected the commandment of Nebuchadnezzar the king and did not worship the image that he made."
					},
					{
						"text": "And as for those who transgressed the commandment of God, the fire at once prevailed over them and burned them, and they were burned without mercy."
					},
					{
						"text": "For the Sodomites were burned like straw and reed and stubble."
					},
					{
						"text": "Furthermore, Nadab and Abihu were burned, who transgressed the commandment of God."
					},
					{
						"text": "Again, two hundred and fifty men were burned, who were offering incense."
					},
					{
						"text": "Again, two princes and a hundred who were with them were burned, because they approached the mountain on which Elijah was sitting, who ascended in a chariot of fire to heaven."
					},
					{
						"text": "The calumniators also were burned because they dug a pit for righteous men."
					},
					{
						"text": "Accordingly, beloved, the righteous shall be tried by the fire, like gold and silver and goodly stones, and the wicked shall be burned in the fire like straw and reed and stubble, and the fire shall have power upon them and they shall be burned; even as the Prophet Isaiah said:—By fire shall the Lord judge and by it shall He try all flesh."
					},
					{
						"text": "And again he said:—Ye shall go out and see the carcases of the men who offended against Me, whose worm shall not die, nor shall their fire be quenched, and they shall be an astonishment to all flesh."
					},
					{
						"text": "13."
					},
					{
						"text": "And again the Apostle has commented for us upon this building and upon this foundation; for he said thus;—No man can lay another foundation than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ."
					},
					{
						"text": "Again the Apostle said about faith that it is conjoined with hope and love, for he said thus:—These are three which shall abide, faith and hope and love."
					},
					{
						"text": "And he showed with regard to faith that first it is laid on a sure foundation."
					},
					{
						"text": "14."
					},
					{
						"text": "For Abel, because of his faith his offering was accepted."
					},
					{
						"text": "And Enoch, because he was well-pleasing through his faith, was removed from death."
					},
					{
						"text": "Noah, because he believed, was preserved from the deluge."
					},
					{
						"text": "Abraham, through his faith, obtained blessing, and it was accounted to him for righteousness."
					},
					{
						"text": "Isaac, because he believed, was loved."
					},
					{
						"text": "Jacob, because of his faith, was preserved."
					},
					{
						"text": "Joseph, because of his faith, was tried in the waters of contention, and was delivered from his trial, and his Lord established a witness in him, as David said:—Witness hath he established in Joseph."
					},
					{
						"text": "Moses also by his faith performed many wonderful works of power."
					},
					{
						"text": "By his faith he destroyed the Egyptians with ten plagues."
					},
					{
						"text": "Again, by faith he divided the sea, and caused his people to cross over and sank the Egyptians in the midst of it."
					},
					{
						"text": "By faith he cast the wood into the bitter waters and they became sweet."
					},
					{
						"text": "By faith he brought down manna and satisfied his people."
					},
					{
						"text": "By faith he spread out his hands and conquered Amalek, as is written:—His hands continued in faith till the setting of the sun."
					},
					{
						"text": "Also by faith he went up to Mount Sinai, when he twice fasted for the space of forty days."
					},
					{
						"text": "Again by faith he conquered Sihon and Og, the Kings of the Amorites."
					},
					{
						"text": "15."
					},
					{
						"text": "This is wonderful, my beloved, and a great prodigy that Moses did in the Red Sea, when the waters were divided by faith, and stood up on high like mountains or like mighty cliffs."
					},
					{
						"text": "They were checked and stood still at the commandment; they were closed up as in vessels, and fast bound in the height as in the depth."
					},
					{
						"text": "Their fluidity did not overflow the boundary, but rather they changed the nature of their creation."
					},
					{
						"text": "Irrational creatures became obedient."
					},
					{
						"text": "The billows became rigid and were awaiting the vengeance, when the people should have passed over."
					},
					{
						"text": "Wonderful was it how the waves stood still and expected the commandment and the vengeance."
					},
					{
						"text": "The foundations (hidden) from the ages of the world were revealed, and that which from the beginning had been liquid suddenly became dry."
					},
					{
						"text": "The gates lifted up their heads and the everlasting gates were lifted up."
					},
					{
						"text": "The pillar of fire entered and illuminated the entire camp."
					},
					{
						"text": "The people passed over by faith."
					},
					{
						"text": "And the judgment of righteousness was wrought upon Pharaoh and upon his host and upon his chariots."
					},
					{
						"text": "16."
					},
					{
						"text": "Thus also Joshua the son of Nun divided Jordan by his faith, and the children of Israel crossed over as in the days of Moses."
					},
					{
						"text": "But know, my beloved, that this passage of the Jordan was three times laid open by its being divided."
					},
					{
						"text": "First through Joshua the Son of Nun, and secondly through Elijah, and then through Elisha."
					},
					{
						"text": "For the word of the Book makes known that over against this passage of Jericho, there Elijah was taken up to heaven; for when Elisha turned back from following him and divided the Jordan and passed over, the children of the Prophets of Jericho came out to meet Elisha and said:—The spirit of Elijah rests upon Elisha."
					},
					{
						"text": "Furthermore when the people crossed over in the days of Joshua the son of Nun (it was there), for thus it is written:—The people passed over, over against Jericho."
					},
					{
						"text": "Also Joshua the son of Nun by faith cast down the walls of Jericho, and they fell without difficulty."
					},
					{
						"text": "Again by faith he destroyed thirty-one kings and made the children of Israel to inherit the land."
					},
					{
						"text": "Furthermore by his faith he spread out his hands towards heaven and stayed the sun in Gibeon and the moon in the valley of Ajalon."
					},
					{
						"text": "And they were stayed and stood still from their courses."
					},
					{
						"text": "But enough!  All the righteous, our fathers, in all that they did were victorious through faith, as also the blessed Apostle testified with regard to all of them:—By faith they prevailed."
					},
					{
						"text": "Again Solomon said:—Many men are called merciful, but a faithful man who can find?  Also Job thus said:—My integrity, shall not pass from me, and in my righteousness will persist."
					},
					{
						"text": "17."
					},
					{
						"text": "Also our Saviour used thus to say to every one who drew near to Him to be healed:—According to thy faith be unto thee."
					},
					{
						"text": "And when the blind man approached Him, He said to him:—Dost thou believe that I am able to heal thee?  That blind man said to Him:—Yea, Lord, I believe."
					},
					{
						"text": "And his faith opened his eyes."
					},
					{
						"text": "And to him whose son was sick, He said:—Believe and thy son shall live."
					},

						"text": "He said to Him:—I believe, Lord; help thou my feeble faith."
					},
					{
						"text": "And by his faith his son was healed."
					},
					{
						"text": "And also when the nobleman came near to Him, by his faith was his boy healed, when he said to our Lord:—Speak the word and my servant will be cured."
					},
					{
						"text": "And our Lord was astonished at his faith, and according to his faith it happened to him."
					},
					{
						"text": "And also when the chief of the Synagogue requested Him concerning his daughter, He said thus to him:—Only firmly believe and thy daughter shall live."
					},
					{
						"text": "So he believed and his daughter lived and arose."
					},
					{
						"text": "And when Lazarus died, our Lord said to Martha:—If thou believest, thy brother shall rise."

					{
						"text": "Martha saith unto Him;—Yea, Lord, I believe."

					{
						"text": "And He raised him after four days."
					},
					{
						"text": "And also Simon who was called Cephas because of his faith was called the firm rock."

					},

					},
					{

						"text": "And thorns and weeds shall grow up in it."
					},
					{
						"text": "And I will command the clouds that they send not down rain upon it."
					},

					{
						"text": "When the vine was without blemish, it did not prove of service."

					{
						"text": "Now that the fire has devoured it and that it is laid waste, how shall it prove of service?  The fire has devoured its two branches and its inward parts are wasted."

						"text": "And they slew them and did not send the fruit to the Lord of the vineyard."

						"text": "After the servants the beloved Son was sent, to receive from them the fruit and to bring it back to Him that sent Him."
					},
					{
						"text": "And they seized Him and cast Him out of the vineyard; and they cut spikes from the thorns of the vineyard and fixed them in His hands."
					},

						"text": "And He was hungry and asked food of them; and they took and gave Him gall from the fruit of the vineyard."
					},
					{
						"text": "He was thirsty and asked of them drink; and they gave Him vinegar and He would not drink it."
					},
					{
						"text": "And they platted a crown of thorns that had sprung up in the vineyard, and placed it on the head of the Son of the Lord of the vineyard."
					},
					{
						"text": "For from the time that the vineyard was made, it displayed these fruits."
					},
					{
						"text": "Therefore its Lord uprooted it and cast it in the fire; and planted good fruit-bearing vines in the vineyard, and such as gladden the husbandman."
					},
					{
						"text": "For Christ is the vineyard, and His Father is the husbandman; and they who drink of His cup are the vines."
					},
					{
						"text": "Therefore vineyard was formed instead of vineyard."
					},
					{
						"text": "And furthermore at His coming He handed over the kingdom to the Romans, as the children of Esau are called."

					{
						"text": "And these children of Esau will keep the kingdom for its giver."

					{
						"text": "23."
					},
					{
						"text": "And the holy People inherited an eternal Kingdom; the holy people who were chosen instead of the People."

					{
						"text": "For He provoked them to jealousy with a people that was not a people."
					},
					{
						"text": "And with a foolish people He angered them."
					},
					{
						"text": "And He set free the holy people."
					},
					{
						"text": "For lo! every covenant of God is freed from the burden of kings and princes."
					},
					{
						"text": "For even if a man has served the heathen, as soon as ever he draws nigh unto the covenant of God, he is set free."
					},
					{
						"text": "But the Jews are toiling in bondage amongst the Gentiles."
					},
					{
						"text": "For thus he said about the Saints;—They shall inherit the Kingdom that is beneath the heaven."
					},
					{
						"text": "But if he had said it about them (the Jews), why are they toiling in service amongst the Gentiles?  And if they say that it has not taken place as yet; then (we ask) is the Kingdom that shall be given to the Son of man, to be heavenly or earthly?  And lo! the children of the Kingdom are sealed, and they have received their emancipation from this world."
					},
					{
						"text": "For since it exists now, it will not be willing to be subjected to the power of the King, Who shall come and take to Himself His Kingdom."
					},
					{
						"text": "But it will guard His pledges with honour, that when He shall come to bring to nought the Kingdom, he may come upon them not in anger."
					},
					{
						"text": "For when He, Whose is the Kingdom, shall come in His second coming, He will take to Himself whatever He has given."
					},
					{
						"text": "And He Himself will be King for ever and ever."
					},
					{
						"text": "And His Kingdom shall not pass away, because it is an eternal Kingdom."
					},
					{
						"text": "24."
					},
					{
						"text": "For first, He gave the Kingdom to the sons of Jacob, and subdued to them the children of Esau; as Isaac said to Esau:—Thou shalt serve Jacob thy brother."
					},
					{
						"text": "And when again they did not prosper in the Kingdom, He took it away from the children of Jacob and gave it to the children of Esau until He should come Whose it is."
					},
					{
						"text": "And they will deliver up the deposit to its Giver, and will not deal fraudulently with it."
					},
					{
						"text": "And the Guardian of the Kingdom is subject to Him to Whom all things are subject."
					},
					{
						"text": "Therefore this Kingdom of the children of Esau shall not be delivered up into the hand of the hosts that are gathered together, that desire to go up against it; because the Kingdom is being kept safe for its Giver, and He Himself will preserve it."
					},
					{
						"text": "And as to this that I wrote to thee, beloved, that the Kingdom of the children of Esau is being kept safe for its Giver, doubt not about it, that that Kingdom will not be conquered."
					},
					{
						"text": "For a mighty champion Whose name is Jesus shall come with power, and bearing as His armour all the power of the Kingdom."
					},
					{
						"text": "And search out and see that also by the poll-tax He was enrolled amongst them."
					},
					{
						"text": "And as He was enrolled by the poll-tax amongst them, He will also succour them."
					},
					{
						"text": "And His standard abounds in that place, and they are clothed in His armour, and shall not be found wanting in war."
					},
					{
						"text": "And if thou shouldest say unto me:—\"In the years of the Kings that preceded these, why did they conquer and subdue the beast?\"  It was because the chiefs and kings who stood up at that time in the Kingdom of the children of Esau did not wish to lead with them to the war the Man who was enrolled with them in the poll-tax."
					},

					},
					{
						"text": "And if any man dispute about them, say thus to him, that these words are not concluded, because the words of God are infinite, nor will they be concluded."
					},

					},
					{
						"text": "And again, it is not possible to add to them or to diminish from them."

					{
						"text": "Therefore, have thou no disputation about these things, but say:—\"These things are so."
					},
					{
						"text": "That is enough\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "But hear these things from me, and also enquire about them of our brethren, children of our faith."

					},

For lo! there is nothing in the tomb\"."

And lo! her travail-pains are near; as Isaiah said, Who hath seen anything like this and who hath heard such things as these? that the earth should travail in one day, and a people should be born in one hour?  For Adam unsown sprang up; unconceived he was born."

He showed beforehand, that he was looking forward to the quickening of the dead; that, when the Resurrection shout should be raised and the sound of the trumpet (heard), he might rise up near to his fathers, and might not at the time of the Resurrection be mingled with the wicked who shall return to Sheol and to punishment."

					{
						"text": "And why, my beloved, was the righteous Moses grieved because he did not enter into the land of promise?  Clearly, because he wished to go and be buried with his fathers, and not be buried in the land of his adversaries, in the land of Moab."
					},
					{
						"text": "For the Moabites hired Balaam the son of Beor to curse Israel."
					},

						"text": "And as Moses gazed upon all the land, and gazed upon the mountain of the Jebusites where the Tabernacle was to dwell, he was grieved and wept when he saw the tomb in Hebron where his fathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were buried, that he should not be buried with them, nor his bones cast upon their bones, that he might rise along with them in the Resurrection."
					},
					{
						"text": "But when he had seen all the land, his Lord encouraged him and said to him, \"I myself will bury thee and hide thee, and none shall know thy tomb\"."

						"text": "So they made them a calf and worshipped it, and they remembered not God Who brought them up from Egypt by means of Moses with a mighty hand and an uplifted arm."

Clearly, when they shall hear the sound of trumpet summoning them, and the cornet sounding forth from on high, and the earthquake that shall be, and the tombs that shall be opened, then the mighty ones shall arise in glory, and recount one to another in the tombs, saying, \"Great is the grace that is performed towards us."

					},
					{
						"text": "He showed it beforehand plainly; for through Elijah a wonder was manifested, (in proof) that the dead shall live and that they that sleep in the dust shall arise."
					},
					{
						"text": "For when the son of the widow died, Elijah raised him up and gave him to his mother."
					},
					{
						"text": "And Elisha again, his disciple, raised up the son of the Shunamite; that the testimony of two might be established and confirmed for us."

And Ezekiel said to Him:—Thou knowest, O Lord of lords."
					},
					{

					},
					{
						"text": "And their dryness was made moist, and the joints were united by the ligatures, and the blood grew warm in the arteries, and skin was stretched over the flesh, and hair grew up according to its nature."
					},
					{
						"text": "But they lay prostrate and there was no breath in them."
					},

					},
					{
						"text": "But why, my beloved, was it that those dead did not rise because of the one word (spoken) through Ezekiel, and why was not their resurrection, both of bones and spirit, accomplished (through that one word)?  For lo! by one word the bones were fitted together, and by another the spirit came."
					},
					{
						"text": "It was in order that full perfection might be left for our Lord Jesus Christ, Who with one utterance and one word will raise up at the last day every body of man."
					},

						"text": "For in that resurrection in which all men shall rise, none shall fall again; and by one word of God, sent forth through Christ, all the dead shall rise in the twinkling of an eye, speedily."

					},
					{
						"text": "For with one word of summons He will cause all the ends (of the world) to hear, and all that are laid (in the grave) shall leap forth and rise up; and no word shall return void to Him that sent it forth, but as it is written in the Prophet Isaiah, who compares the word to rain and snow; for he said:—As the rain and the snow come down from heaven and return not thither, but fertilize the earth and cause it to bring forth and give seed to the sower and bread for food, so shall the word be that goes forth from My mouth, and it shall not return to Me void, but shall accomplish whatsoever I desire and shall accomplish that for which I shall have sent it."
					},
					{
						"text": "For the rain and the snow do not return to heaven, but accomplish in the earth the will of Him that sends them."
					},
					{
						"text": "So the word that He shall send through His Christ, Who is Himself the Word and the Message, shall return to Him with great power."
					},
					{
						"text": "For when He shall come and bring it, He shall come down like rain and snow, and through Him all that is sown shall spring up and bear righteous fruit, and the word shall return to His sender; but not in vain shall His going have been, but thus shall He say in the presence of His sender:—Behold, I and the children that the Lord has given Me."
					},
					{

						"text": "And this is that voice of God which shall sound from on high and raise up all the dead."
					},
					{
						"text": "16."
					},
					{
						"text": "Again, our Lord explained to the Sadducees with regard to the resurrection of the dead, when they brought forth to Him the parable of the woman who was married to seven husbands, and said to Him:—Lo! the woman was wife of them all; in the Resurrection of the dead, to which of them shall she be wife?  Then our Lord said to them:—Ye do greatly err, and ye know not the Scriptures nor the power of God."
					},
					{
						"text": "For they who are worthy of that world and of that Resurrection from the dead, they that are men do not take wives, nor are the women married to husbands, for they cannot die, for they are as the angels of God and children of the Resurrection."

					},
					{
						"text": "17."
					},
					{

					},
					{
						"text": "And after he had transgressed the commandment, and had eaten, he lived nine hundred and thirty years; but he was accounted dead unto God because of his sins."
					},
					{
						"text": "But that it may be made certain for thee that a sinner is called dead even when he lives, I will make it clear to thee."

					},
					{
						"text": "18."
					},
					{
						"text": "Moreover our Lord said to that man who said to Him:—Let me go and bury my father, and I will come to Thee."
					},
					{
						"text": "And our Lord said to him, Let the dead bury their dead, but go thou, preach the Kingdom of God."
					},
					{
						"text": "But how is this word understood by thee, my beloved?  Didst thou ever see the dead burying their dead?  Or how shall a dead man arise to bury another dead man?  But receive this explanation from me, that a sinner, while he is living, is dead unto God; and a righteous man, though dead, is alive unto God."
					},

					},
					{
						"text": "For the servant, for whom his Lord is preparing stripes and bonds, while he is sleeping desires not to awake, for he knows that when the dawn shall have come and he shall awake, his Lord will scourge and bind him."
					},
					{
						"text": "But the good servant, to whom his Lord has promised gifts, looks expectantly for the time when dawn shall come and he shall receive presents from his Lord."
					},

					},
					{
						"text": "As for the wicked, his sleep is not pleasant to him, for he imagines that lo! the dawn has come for him, and his heart is broken in his dream."
					},
