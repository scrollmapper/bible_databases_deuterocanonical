					{
						"text": "I had many genuine and true friends, men who understood the laws of friendship, and faithfully observed them; but out of this large number there was one who excelled all the rest in his attachment to me, striving to outstrip them as much as they themselves outstripped ordinary acquaintance."
					},
					{
						"text": "He was one of those who were constantly at my side; for we were engaged in the same studies, and employed the same teachers."
					},
					{
						"text": "We had the same eagerness and zeal about the studies at which we worked, and a passionate desire produced by the same circumstances was equally strong in both of us."
					},
					{
						"text": "For not only when we were attending school, but after we had left it, when it became necessary to consider what course of life it would be best for us to adopt, we found ourselves to be of the same mind."
					},
					{
						"text": "Chapter."
					},
					{
						"text": "And in addition to these, there were other things also which preserved and maintained this concord unbroken and secure."
					},
					{
						"text": "For as regarded the greatness of our fatherland neither had one cause to vaunt himself over the other, nor was I burdened with riches, and he pinched by poverty, but our means corresponded as closely as our tastes."
					},
					{
						"text": "Our families also were of equal rank, and thus everything concurred with our disposition."
					},
					{
						"text": "Chapter."
					},
					{
						"text": "But when it became our duty to pursue the blessed life of monks, and the true philosophy, our balance was no longer even, but his scale mounted high, while I, still entangled in the lusts of this world, dragged mine down and kept it low, weighting it with those fancies in which youths are apt to indulge."
					},
					{
						"text": "For the future our friendship indeed remained as firm as it was before, but our intercourse was interrupted; for it was impossible for persons who were not interested about the same things to spend much time together."
					},
					{
						"text": "But as soon as I also began to emerge a little from the flood of worldliness, he received me with open arms; yet not even thus could we maintain our former equality: for having got the start of me in time, and having displayed great earnestness, he rose again above my level, and soared to a great height."
					},
					{
						"text": "Chapter."
					},
					{
						"text": "Being a good man, however, and placing a high value on my friendship, he separated himself from all the rest (of the brethren), and spent the whole of his time with me, which he had desired to do before, but had been prevented as I was saying by my frivolity."
					},
					{
						"text": "For it was impossible for a man who attended the law-courts, and was in a flutter of excitement about the pleasures of the stage, to be often in the company of one who was nailed to his books, and never set foot in the market place."
					},
					{
						"text": "Consequently when the hindrances were removed, and he had brought me into the same condition of life as himself, he gave free vent to the desire with which he had long been laboring."
					},
					{
						"text": "He could not bear leaving me even for a moment, and he persistently urged that we should each of us abandon our own home and share a common dwelling:—in fact he persuaded me, and the affair was taken in hand."

						"text": "Chapter."

					{
						"text": "But the continual lamentations of my mother hindered me from granting him the favor, or rather from receiving this boon at his hands."
					},
					{
						"text": "For when she perceived that I was meditating this step, she took me into her own private chamber, and, sitting near me on the bed where she had given birth to me, she shed torrents of tears, to which she added words yet more pitiable than her weeping, in the following lamentable strain: My child, it was not the will of Heaven that I should long enjoy the benefit of thy father's virtue."
					},
					{
						"text": "For his death soon followed the pangs which I endured at thy birth, leaving thee an orphan and me a widow before my time to face all the horrors of widowhood, which only those who have experienced them can fairly understand."
					},
					{
						"text": "For no words are adequate to describe the tempest-tossed condition of a young woman who, having but lately left her paternal home, and being inexperienced in business, is suddenly racked by an overwhelming sorrow, and compelled to support a load of care too great for her age and sex."
					},
					{
						"text": "For she has to correct the laziness of servants, and to be on the watch for their rogueries, to repel the designs of relations, to bear bravely the threats of those who collect the public taxes, and harshness in the imposition of rates."
					},
					{
						"text": "And if the departed one should have left a child, even if it be a girl, great anxiety will be caused to the mother, although free from much expense and fear: but a boy fills her with ten thousand alarms and many anxieties every day, to say nothing of the great expense which one is compelled to incur if she wishes to bring him up in a liberal way."
					},
					{
						"text": "None of these things, however, induced me to enter into a second marriage, or introduce a second husband into thy father's house: but I held on as I was, in the midst of the storm and uproar, and did not shun the iron furnace of widowhood."
					},
					{
						"text": "My foremost help indeed was the grace from above; but it was no small consolation to me under those terrible trials to look continually on thy face and to preserve in thee a living image of him who had gone, an image indeed which was a fairly exact likeness."
					},
					{
						"text": "On this account, even when thou wast an infant, and hadst not yet learned to speak, a time when children are the greatest delight to their parents, thou didst afford me much comfort."
					},
					{
						"text": "Nor indeed can you complain that, although I bore my widowhood bravely, I diminished thy patrimony, which I know has been the fate of many who have had the misfortune to be orphans."
					},
					{
						"text": "For, besides keeping the whole of it intact, I spared no expense which was needful to give you an honorable position, spending for this purpose some of my own fortune, and of my marriage dowry."
					},
					{
						"text": "Yet do not think that I say these things by way of reproaching you; only in return for all these benefits I beg one favor: do not plunge me into a second widowhood; nor revive the grief which is now laid to rest: wait for my death: it may be in a little while I shall depart."
					},
					{
						"text": "The young indeed look forward to a distant old age; but we who have grown old have nothing but death to wait for."
					},
					{
						"text": "When, then, you shall have committed my body to the ground, and mingled my bones with thy father's, embark for a long voyage, and set sail on any sea thou wilt: then there will be no one to hinder thee: but as long as my life lasts, be content to live with me."
					},
					{
						"text": "Do not, I pray you, oppose God in vain, involving me without cause, who have done you no wrong, in these great calamities."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if you have any reason to complain that I drag you into worldly cares, and force you to attend to business, do not be restrained by any reverence for the laws of nature, for training or custom, but fly from me as an enemy; but if, on the contrary, I do everything to provide leisure for thy journey through this life, let this bond at least if nothing else keep thee by me."
					},
					{
						"text": "For couldst thou say that ten thousand loved thee, yet no one will afford thee the enjoyment of so much liberty, seeing there is no one who is equally anxious for thy welfare."
					},
					{
						"text": "Chapter."
					},
					{
						"text": "These words, and more, my mother spake to me, and I related them to that noble youth."
					},
					{
						"text": "But he, so far from being disheartened by these speeches, was the more urgent in making the same request as before."
					},
					{
						"text": "Now while we were thus situated, he continually entreating, and I refusing my assent, we were both of us disturbed by a report suddenly reaching us that we were about to be advanced to the dignity of the episcopate."
					},
					{
						"text": "As soon as I heard this rumor I was seized with alarm and perplexity: with alarm lest I should be made captive against my will, and perplexity, inquiring as I often did whence any such idea concerning us could have entered the minds of these men; for looking to myself I found nothing worthy of such an honor."
					},
					{
						"text": "But that noble youth having come to me privately, and having conferred with me about these things as if with one who was ignorant of the rumor, begged that we might in this instance also as formerly shape our action and our counsels the same way: for he would readily follow me whichever course I might pursue, whether I attempted flight or submitted to be captured."
					},
					{
						"text": "Perceiving then his eagerness, and considering that I should inflict a loss upon the whole body of the Church if, owing to my own weakness, I were to deprive the flock of Christ of a young man who was so good and so well qualified for the supervision of large numbers, I abstained from disclosing to him the purpose which I had formed, although I had never before allowed any of my plans to be concealed from him."
					},
					{
						"text": "I now told him that it would be best to postpone our decision concerning this matter to another season, as it was not immediately pressing, and by so doing persuaded him to dismiss it from his thoughts, and at the same time encouraged him to hope that, if such a thing should ever happen to us, I should be of the same mind with him."
					},
					{
						"text": "But after a short time, when one who was to ordain us arrived, I kept myself concealed, but Basil, ignorant of this, was taken away on another pretext, and made to take the yoke, hoping from the promises which I had made to him that I should certainly follow, or rather supposing that he was following me."
					},
					{
						"text": "For some of those who were present, seeing that he resented being seized, deceived him by exclaiming how strange it was that one who was generally reputed to be the more hot tempered (meaning me), had yielded very mildly to the judgment of the Fathers, whereas he, who was reckoned a much wiser and milder kind of man, had shown himself hotheaded and conceited, being unruly, restive, and contradictory."
					},
					{
						"text": "Having yielded to these remonstrances, and afterwards having learned that I had escaped capture, he came to me in deep dejection, sat down near me and tried to speak, but was hindered by distress of mind and inability to express in words the violence to which he had been subjected."
					},
					{
						"text": "No sooner had he opened his mouth than he was prevented from utterance by grief cutting short his words before they could pass his lips."
					},
					{
						"text": "Seeing, then, his tearful and agitated condition, and knowing as I did the cause, I laughed for joy, and, seizing his right hand, I forced a kiss on him, and praised God that my plan had ended so successfully, as I had always prayed it might."
					},
					{
						"text": "But when he saw that I was delighted and beaming with joy, and understood that he had been deceived by me, he was yet more vexed and distressed."
					},
					{
						"text": "Chapter."
					},
					{
						"text": "And when he had a little recovered from this agitation of mind, he began: If you have rejected the part allotted to you, and have no further regard for me (I know not indeed for what cause), you ought at least to consider your own reputation; but as it is you have opened the mouths of all, and the world is saying that you have declined this ministry through love of vainglory, and there is no one who will deliver you from this accusation."
					},
					{
						"text": "As for me, I cannot bear to go into the market place; there are so many who come up to me and reproach me every day."
					},
					{
						"text": "For, when they see me anywhere in the city, all my intimate friends take me aside, and cast the greater part of the blame upon me."
					},
					{
						"text": "Knowing his intention, they say, for none of his affairs could be kept secret from you, you should not have concealed it, but ought to have communicated it to us, and we should have been at no loss to devise some plan for capturing him."
					},
					{
						"text": "But I am too much ashamed and abashed to tell them that I did not know you had long been plotting this trick, lest they should say that our friendship was a mere pretence."
					},
					{
						"text": "For even if it is so, as indeed it is—nor would you yourself deny it after what you have done to me—yet it is well to hide our misfortune from the outside world, and persons who entertain but a moderate opinion of us."
					},
					{
						"text": "I shrink from telling them the truth, and how things really stand with us, and I am compelled in future to keep silence, and look down on the ground, and turn away to avoid those whom I meet."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if I escape the condemnation on the former charge, I am forced to undergo judgment for speaking falsehood."
					},
					{
						"text": "For they will never believe me when I say that you ranged Basil amongst those who are not permitted to know your secret affairs."
					},
					{
						"text": "Of this, however, I will not take much account, since it has seemed agreeable to you, but how shall we endure the future disgrace? for some accuse you of arrogance, others of vainglory: while those who are our more merciful accusers, lay both these offences to our charge, and add that we have insulted those who did us honor, although had they experienced even greater indignity it would only have served them right for passing over so many and such distinguished men and advancing mere youths, who were but yesterday immersed in the interests of this world, to such a dignity as they never have dreamed of obtaining, in order that they may for a brief season knit the eyebrows, wear dusky garments, and put on a grave face."
					},
					{
						"text": "Those who from the dawn of manhood to extreme old age have diligently practised self-discipline, are now to be placed under the government of youths who have not even heard the laws which should regulate their administration of this office."
					},
					{
						"text": "I am perpetually assailed by persons who say such things and worse, and am at a loss how to reply to them; but I pray you tell me: for I do not suppose that you took to flight and incurred such hatred from such distinguished men without cause or consideration, but that your decision was made with reasoning and circumspection: whence also I conjecture that you have some argument ready for your defence."
					},
					{
						"text": "Tell me, then, whether there is any fair excuse which I can make to those who accuse us."
					},
					{
						"text": "For I do not demand any account for the wrongs which I have sustained at your hands, nor for the deceit or treachery you have practised, nor for the advantage which you have derived from me in the past."
					},
					{
						"text": "For I placed my very life, so to say, in your hands, yet you have treated me with as much guile as if it had been your business to guard yourself against an enemy."
					},
					{
						"text": "Yet if you knew this decision of ours to be profitable, you ought not to have avoided the gain: if on the contrary injurious, you should have saved me also from the loss, as you always said that you esteemed me before every one else."
					},
					{
						"text": "But you have done everything to make me fall into the snare: and you had no need of guile and hypocrisy in dealing with one who was wont to display the utmost sincerity and candor in speech and action towards thee."
					},
					{
						"text": "Nevertheless, as I said, I do not now accuse you of any of these things, or reproach you for the lonely position in which you have placed me by breaking off those conferences from which we often derived no small pleasure and profit; but all these things I pass by, and bear in silence and meekness, not that thou hast acted meekly in transgressing against me, but because from the day that I cherished thy friendship I laid it down as a rule for myself, that whatever sorrow you might cause me I would never force you to the necessity of an apology."
					},
					{
						"text": "For you know yourself that you have inflicted no small loss on me if at least you remember what we were always saying ourselves, and the outside world also said concerning us, that it was a great gain for us to be of one mind and be guarded by each other's friendship."
					},
					{
						"text": "Every one said, indeed, that our concord would bring no small advantage to many besides ourselves; I never perceived, however, so far as I am concerned, how it could be of advantage to others: but I did say that we should at least derive this benefit from it: that those who wished to contend with us would find us difficult to master."
					},
					{
						"text": "And I never ceased reminding you of these things: saying the age is a cruel one, and designing men are many, genuine love is no more, and the deadly pest of envy has crept into its place: we walk in the midst of snares, and on the edge of battlements; those who are ready to rejoice in our misfortunes, if any should befall us, are many and beset us from many quarters: whereas there is no one to condole with us, or at least the number of such may be easily counted."
					},
					{
						"text": "Beware that we do not by separation incur much ridicule, and damage worse than ridicule."
					},
					{
						"text": "Brother aided by brother is like a strong city, and well fortified kingdom."
					},
					{
						"text": "Do not dissolve this genuine intimacy, nor break down the fortress."
					},
					{
						"text": "Such things and more I was continually saying, not indeed that I ever suspected anything of this kind, but supposing you to be entirely sound in your relation towards me, I did it as a superfluous precaution, wishing to preserve in health one who was already sound; but unwittingly, as it seems, I was administering medicines to a sick man: and even so I have not been fortunate enough to do any good, and have gained nothing by my excess of forethought."
					},
					{
						"text": "For having totally cast away all these considerations, without giving them a thought, you have turned me adrift like an unballasted vessel on an untried ocean, taking no heed of those fierce billows which I must encounter."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if it should ever be my lot to undergo calumny, or mockery, or any other kind of insult or menace (and such things must frequently occur), to whom shall I fly for refuge: to whom shall I impart my distress, who will be willing to succour me and drive back my assailants and put a stop to their assaults? who will solace me and prepare me to bear the coarse ribaldry which may yet be in store for me."
					},
					{
						"text": "There is no one since you stand aloof from this terrible strife, and cannot even hear my cry."
					},
					{
						"text": "Seest thou then what mischief thou hast wrought? now that thou hast dealt the blow, dost thou perceive what a deadly wound thou hast inflicted? But let all this pass: for it is impossible to undo the past, or to find a path through pathless difficulties."
					},
					{
						"text": "What shall I say to the outside world? what defence shall I make to their accusations."
					},
					{
						"text": "Chapter."
					},
					{
						"text": "Chrysostom: Be of good cheer, I replied, for I am not only ready to answer for myself in these matters, but I will also endeavor as well as I am able to render an account of those for which you have not held me answerable."
					},
					{
						"text": "Indeed, if you wish it, I will make them the starting-point of my defence."
					},
					{
						"text": "For it would be a strange piece of stupidity on my part if, thinking only of praise from the outside public, and doing my best to silence their accusations, I were unable to convince my dearest of all friends that I am not wronging him, and were to treat him with indifference greater than the zeal which he has displayed on my behalf, treating me with such forbearance as even to refrain from accusing me of the wrongs which he says he has suffered from me, and putting his own interests out of the question in consideration for mine."
					},
					{
						"text": "What is the wrong that I have done thee, since I have determined to embark from this point upon the sea of apology? Is it that I misled you and concealed my purpose? Yet I did it for the benefit of thyself who wast deceived, and of those to whom I surrendered you by means of this deceit."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if the evil of deception is absolute, and it is never right to make use of it, I am prepared to pay any penalty you please: or rather, as you will never endure to inflict punishment upon me, I shall subject myself to the same condemnation which is pronounced by judges on evil-doers when their accusers have convicted them."
					},
					{
						"text": "But if the thing is not always harmful, but becomes good or bad according to the intention of those who practise it, you must desist from complaining of deceit, and prove that it has been devised against you for a bad purpose; and as long as this proof is wanting it would only be fair for those who wish to conduct themselves prudently, not only to abstain from reproaches and accusation, but even to give a friendly reception to the deceiver."
					},
					{
						"text": "For a well-timed deception, undertaken with an upright intention, has such advantages, that many persons have often had to undergo punishment for abstaining from fraud."
					},
					{
						"text": "And if you investigate the history of generals who have enjoyed the highest reputation from the earliest ages, you will find that most of their triumphs were achieved by stratagem, and that such are more highly commended than those who conquer in open fight."
					},
					{
						"text": "For the latter conduct their campaigns with greater expenditure of money and men, so that they gain nothing by the victory, but suffer just as much distress as those who have been defeated, both in the sacrifice of troops and the exhaustion of funds."
					},
					{
						"text": "But, besides this, they are not even permitted to enjoy all the glory which pertains to the victory; for no small part of it is reaped by those who have fallen, because in spirit they were victorious, their defeat was only a bodily one: so that had it been possible for them not to fall when they were wounded, and death had not come and put the finishing stroke to their labors, there would have been no end of their prowess."
					},
					{
						"text": "But one who has been able to gain the victory by stratagem involves the enemy in ridicule as well as disaster."
					},
					{
						"text": "Again, in the other case both sides equally carry off the honors bestowed upon valor, whereas in this case they do not equally obtain those which are bestowed on wisdom, but the prize falls entirely to the victors, and, another point no less important is that they preserve the joy of the victory for the state unalloyed; for abundance of resources and multitudes of men are not like mental powers: the former indeed if continually used in war necessarily become exhausted, and fail those who possess them, whereas it is the nature of wisdom to increase the more it is exercised."
					},
					{
						"text": "And not in war only, but also in peace the need of deceit may be found, not merely in reference to the affairs of the state, but also in private life, in the dealings of husband with wife and wife with husband, son with father, friend with friend, and also children with a parent."
					},
					{
						"text": "For the daughter of Saul would not have been able to rescue her husband out of Saul's hands except by deceiving her father."
					},
					{
						"text": "And her brother, wishing to save him whom she had rescued when he was again in danger, made use of the same weapon as the wife."
					},
					{
						"text": "Basil: But none of these cases apply to me: for I am not an enemy, nor one of those who are striving to injure thee, but quite the contrary."
					},
					{
						"text": "For I entrusted all my interests to your judgment, and always followed it whenever you bid me."
					},
					{
						"text": "Chrysostom: But, my admirable and excellent Sir, this is the very reason why I took the precaution of saying that it was a good thing to employ this kind of deceit, not only in war, and in dealing with enemies, but also in peace, and in dealing with our dearest friends."
					},
					{
						"text": "For as a proof that it is beneficial not only to the deceivers, but also to those who are deceived; if you go to any of the physicians and ask them how they relieve their patients from disease, they will tell you that they do not depend upon their professional skill alone, but sometimes conduct the sick to health by availing themselves of deceit, and blending the assistance which they derive from it with their art."
					},
					{
						"text": "For when the waywardness of the patient and the obstinacy of the complaint baffle the counsels of the physicians, it is then necessary to put on the mask of deceit in order that, as on the stage, they may be able to hide what really takes place."
					},
					{
						"text": "But, if you please, I will relate to you one instance of stratagem out of many which I have heard of being contrived by the sons of the healing art."
					},
					{
						"text": "A man was once suddenly attacked by a fever of great severity; the burning heat increased, and the patient rejected the remedies which could have reduced it and craved for a draught of pure wine, passionately entreating all who approached to give it him and enable him to satiate this deadly craving—I say deadly, for if any one had gratified this request he would not only have exasperated the fever, but also have driven the unhappy man frantic."
					},
					{
						"text": "Thereupon, professional skill being baffled, and at the end of its resources and utterly thrown away, stratagem stepped in and displayed its power in the way which I will now relate."
					},
					{
						"text": "For the physician took an earthen cup brought straight out of the furnace, and having steeped it in wine, then drew it out empty, filled it with water, and, having ordered the chamber where the sick man lay to be darkened with curtains that the light might not reveal the trick, he gave it him to drink, pretending that it was filled with undiluted wine."
					},
					{
						"text": "And the man, before he had taken it in his hands, being deceived by the smell, did not wait to examine what was given him, but convinced by the odor, and deceived by the darkness, eagerly gulped down the draught, and being satiated with it immediately shook off the feeling of suffocation and escaped the imminent peril."
					},
					{
						"text": "Do you see the advantage of deceit? And if any one were to reckon up all the tricks of physicians the list would run on to an indefinite length."
					},
					{
						"text": "And not only those who heal the body but those also who attend to the diseases of the soul may be found continually making use of this remedy."
					},
					{
						"text": "Thus the blessed Paul attracted those multitudes of Jews: with this purpose he circumcised Timothy, although he warned the Galatians in his letter that Christ would not profit those who were circumcised."
					},
					{
						"text": "For this cause he submitted to the law, although he reckoned the righteousness which came from the law but loss after receiving the faith in Christ."
					},
					{
						"text": "For great is the value of deceit, provided it be not introduced with a mischievous intention."
					},
					{
						"text": "In fact action of this kind ought not to be called deceit, but rather a kind of good management, cleverness and skill, capable of finding out ways where resources fail, and making up for the defects of the mind."
					},
					{
						"text": "For I would not call Phinees a murderer, although he slew two human beings with one stroke: nor yet Elias after the slaughter of the  soldiers, and the captain, and the torrents of blood which he caused to be shed by the destruction of those who sacrificed to devils."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if we were to concede this, and to examine the bare deeds in themselves apart from the intention of the doers, one might if he pleased judge Abraham guilty of child-murder and accuse his grandson and descendant of wickedness and guile."
					},
					{
						"text": "For the one got possession of the birthright, and the other transferred the wealth of the Egyptians to the host of the Israelites."
					},
					{
						"text": "But this is not the case: away with the audacious thought! For we not only acquit them of blame, but also admire them because of these things, since even God commended them for the same."
					},
					{
						"text": "For that man would fairly deserve to be called a deceiver who made an unrighteous use of the practice, not one who did so with a salutary purpose."
					},
					{
						"text": "And often it is necessary to deceive, and to do the greatest benefits by means of this device, whereas he who has gone by a straight course has done great mischief to the person whom he has not deceived."

For I fear lest if I took the flock in hand when it was in good condition and well nourished, and then wasted it through my unskilfulness, I should provoke against myself the God who so loved the flock as to give Himself up for their salvation and ransom."

How was it they did not say these things? How! It was because they had been schooled, from the grace of the Spirit, that these things took place not out of weakness, but out of the permission of the Christ; in order that the truth might shine abroad more largely; through bonds and imprisonments and tribulations and straits increasing and rising, to a greater volume."

					},
					{
						"text": "How delightful and lovable is our band of young brethren! For brethren I call you, even now before you have been brought forth, and before your birth I welcome this relationship with you: For I know, I know clearly, to how great an honour you are about to be led, and to how great a dignity; and those who are about to receive dignity, all are wont to honor, even before the dignity is conferred, laying up for themselves beforehand by their attention good will for the future."
					},
					{
						"text": "And this also I myself now do."
					},
					{

					},
					{
						"text": "Wherefore I beseech and entreat you that you remember me when you come into that kingdom, and as Joseph said to the chief butler \"Remember me when it shall be well with thee,\" this also I say now to you, do ye remember me when it is well with you."

					{
						"text": "I do not ask this in return for interpreting your dreams, as he; for I have not come to interpret dreams for you, but to discourse of matters celestial, and to convey to you glad tidings of such good things as \"eye hath not seen, and ear hath not heard and which have entered not into the heart of man, such are the things which God hath prepared for them that love him\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Now Joseph indeed said to that chief butler, \"yet three days and Pharaoh will restore thee to thy chief butlership\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "But I do not say, yet three days and ye shall be set to pour out the wine of a tyrant, but yet thirty days, and not Pharaoh but the king of Heaven shall restore you to the country which is on high, Jerusalem, which is free—to the city which is in the heavens; and he said indeed, \"Thou shalt give the cup into the hands of Pharaoh\"."
					},

					},
					{
						"text": "Such are the gifts of the Bridegroom, greater indeed than your worth, but worthy of his lovingkindness."
					},
					{
						"text": "Wherefore, I count you blessed already before those sacred nuptials, and I do not only count you blessed, but I praise your prudence in that you have not come to your illumination as the most slothful among men, at your last breath, but already, like prudent servants, prepared with much goodwill to obey your master, have brought the neck of your soul with much meekness and readiness beneath the bands of Christ, and have received His easy yoke, and have taken His light burden."

						"text": "For they indeed receive it on their bed, but you in the bosom of the Church, which is the common mother of us all; they indeed with lamentation and weeping, but you rejoicing, and exceeding glad: they sighing, you giving thanks; they indeed lethargic with much fever, you filled with much spiritual pleasure; wherefore in your case all things are in harmony with the gift, but in theirs all are adverse to it."
					},

					},
					{
						"text": "Whenever he sees his children, he thinks of their fatherless condition; whenever he looks from them to his wife, he considers her widowhood; when he sees the servants, he beholds the desolation of the whole house; when he comes back to himself, he calls to mind his own present life, and being about to be torn from it, experiences a great cloud of despondency."

					},
					{
						"text": "Then in the midst of its tumult and confusion, the Priest enters, more formidable than the fever itself, and more distressing than death to the relatives of the sick man."

					},
					{
						"text": "But I have not yet put the finishing stroke to these ills."
					},
					{
						"text": "For in the midst of relatives raising a tumult and making preparations, the soul has often taken its flight, leaving the body desolate; and in many cases, while it was present it was useless, for when it neither recognizes those who are present, nor hears their voice, nor is able to answer those words by which it will make that blessed covenant with the common master of us all, but is as a useless log, or a stone, and he who is about to be illuminated lies there differing nothing from a corpse, what is the profit of initiation in a case of such insensibility?."
					},
					{
						"text": "For he who is about to approach these holy and dread mysteries must be awake and alert, must be clean from all cares of this life, full of much self-restraint, much readiness; he must banish from his mind every thought foreign to the mysteries, and on all sides cleanse and prepare his home, as if about to receive the king himself."

					},
					{
						"text": "\"For what hast thou,\" saith He, \"that thou didst not receive? but if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?\" I wished to say this first of all, why in the world our fathers, passing by the whole year, settled that the children of the Church should be initiated at this season; and for what reason, after the instruction from us, removing your shoes and raiment, unclad and unshod, with but one garment on, they conduct you to hear the words of the exorcisers."
					},

					},
					{
						"text": "But, if you will, let us discourse about the name which this mystic cleansing bears: for its name is not one, but very many and various."

					},
					{
						"text": "It is called also, baptism: \"For as many of you as were baptized into Christ did put on Christ\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "It is called also burial: \"For we were buried\" saith he, \"with him, through baptism, into death\"."

					},
					{
						"text": "It is also possible to speak of other names besides these, but in order that we should not spend our whole time over the names of this free gift, come, return to the first name, and let us finish our discourse by declaring its meaning; but in the meantime, let us extend our teaching a little further."
					},
					{
						"text": "There is that laver by means of the baths, common to all men, which is wont to wipe off bodily uncleanness; and there is the Jewish laver, more honorable than the other, but far inferior to that of grace; and it too wipes off bodily uncleanness but not simply uncleanness of body, since it even reaches to the weak conscience."
					},
					{
						"text": "For there are many matters, which by nature indeed are not unclean, but which become unclean from the weakness of the conscience."
					},
					{
						"text": "And as in the case of little children, masks, and other bugbears are not in themselves alarming, but seem to little children to be alarming, by reason of the weakness of their nature, so it is in the case of those things of which I was speaking; just as to touch dead bodies is not naturally unclean, but when this comes into contact with a weak conscience, it makes him who touches them unclean."
					},
					{
						"text": "For that the thing in question is not unclean naturally, Moses himself who ordained this law showed, when he bore off the entire corpse of Joseph, and yet remained clean."
					},
					{
						"text": "On this account Paul also, discoursing to us about this uncleanness which does not come naturally but by reason of the weakness of the conscience, speaks somewhat in this way, \"Nothing is common of itself save to him who accounteth anything to be common\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Dost thou not see that uncleanness does not arise from the nature of the thing, but from the weakness of the reasoning about it? And again: \"All things indeed are clean, howbeit it is evil to that man who eateth with offense\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Dost thou see that it is not to eat, but to eat with offense, that is the cause of uncleanness?."
					},
					{
						"text": "Such is the defilement from which the laver of the Jews cleansed."
					},
					{
						"text": "But the laver of grace, not such, but the real uncleanness which has introduced defilement into the soul as well as into the body."
					},
					{
						"text": "For it does not make those who have touched dead bodies clean, but those who have set their hand to dead works: and if any man be effeminate, or a fornicator, or an idolator, or a doer of whatever ill you please, or if he be full of all the wickedness there is among men: should he fall into this pool of waters, he comes up again from the divine fountain purer than the sun's rays."
					},
					{
						"text": "And in order that thou mayest not think that what is said is mere vain boasting, hear Paul speaking of the power of the laver, \"Be not deceived: neither idolators, nor fornicators, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with men, nor covetous, not drunkards, not revilers, not extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "And what has this to do with what has been spoken? says one, \"for prove the question whether the power of the laver thoroughly cleanses all these things\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Hear therefore what follows: \"And such were some of you, but ye were washed, but ye were sanctified, but ye were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the spirit of our God\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "We promise to show you that they who approach the laver become clean from all fornication: but the word has shown more, that they have become not only clean, but both holy and just, for it does not say only \"ye were washed,\" but also \"ye were sanctified and were justified\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "What could be more strange than this, when without toil, and exertion, and good works, righteousness is produced? For such is the lovingkindness of the Divine gift that it makes men just without this exertion."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if a letter of the Emperor, a few words being added, sets free those who are liable to countless accusations, and brings others to the highest honors; much rather will the Holy Spirit of God, who is able to do all things, free us from all evil and grant us much righteousness, and fill us with much assurance, and as a spark falling into the wide sea would straightway be quenched, or would become invisible, being overwhelmed by the multitude of the waters, so also all human wickedness, when it falls into the pool of the divine fountain, is more swiftly and easily overwhelmed, and made invisible, than that spark."
					},
					{
						"text": "And for what reason, says one, if the laver take away all our sins, is it called, not a laver of remission of sins, nor a laver of cleansing, but a laver of regeneration? Because it does not simply take away our sins, nor simply cleanse us from our faults, but so as if we were born again."
					},
					{
						"text": "For it creates and fashions us anew not forming us again out of earth, but creating us out of another element, namely, of the nature of water."
					},
					{
						"text": "For it does not simply wipe the vessel clean, but entirely remoulds it again."
					},
					{
						"text": "For that which is wiped clean, even if it be cleaned with care, has traces of its former condition, and bears the remains of its defilement, but that which falls into the new mould, and is renewed by means of the flames, laying aside all uncleanness, comes forth from the furnace, and sends forth the same brilliancy with things newly formed."
					},
					{
						"text": "As therefore any one who takes and recasts a golden statue which has been tarnished by time, smoke, dust, rust, restores it to us thoroughly cleansed and glistening: so too this nature of ours, rusted with the rust of sin, and having gathered much smoke from our faults, and having lost its beauty, which He had from the beginning bestowed upon it from himself, God has taken and cast anew, and throwing it into the waters as into a mould, and instead of fire sending forth the grace of the Spirit, then brings us forth with much brightness, renewed, and made afresh, to rival the beams of the sun, having crushed the old man, and having fashioned a new man, more brilliant than the former."
					},
					{
						"text": "And speaking darkly of this crushing, and this mystic cleansing, the prophet of old said, \"Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "For that the word is in reference to the faithful, what goes before sufficiently shows us, \"For thou art my Son,\" he says, \"to-day have I begotten thee, ask of me and I will give the heathen for three inheritance, the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Dost thou see how he has made mention of the church of the Gentiles, and has spoken of the kingdom of Christ extended on all sides? Then he says again, \"Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron;\" not grievous, but strong: \"thou shalt break them in pieces like a potter's vessel\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Behold then, the laver is more mystically brought forward."
					},
					{
						"text": "For he does not say earthen vessels: but vessels of the potter."
					},
					{
						"text": "But, give heed: For earthen vessels when crushed would not admit of refashioning, on account of the hardness which was gained by them from the fire."
					},
					{
						"text": "But the fact is that the vessels of the potter are not earthen, but of clay; wherefore, also, when they have been distorted, they can easily, by the skill of the artificer, be brought again to a second shape."
					},
					{
						"text": "When, therefore, God speaks of an irremediable calamity, he does not say vessels of the potter, but an earthen vessel; when, for instance, he wished to teach the prophet and the Jews that he delivered up the city to an irremediable calamity, he bade him take an earthen wine-vessel, and crush it before all the people, and say, \"Thus shall this city be destroyed, be broken in pieces\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "But when he wishes to hold out good hopes to them, he brings the prophet to a pottery, and does not show him an earthen vessel, but shows him a vessel of clay, which was in the hands of the potter, falling to the ground: and brings him to it saying, \"If this potter has taken up and remodelled his vessel which has fallen, shall I not much rather be able to restore you when you have fallen?\" It is possible therefore for God not only to restore those who are made of clay, through the laver of regeneration, but to bring back again to their original state, on their careful repentance, those who have received the power of the Spirit, and have lapsed."
					},
					{
						"text": "But this is not the time for you to hear words about repentance, rather may the time never come for you to fall into the need of these remedies, but may you always remain in preservation of the beauty and the brightness which ye are now about to receive, unsullied."
					},
					{
						"text": "In order, then, that ye may ever remain thus, come and let us discourse to you a little about your manner of life."
					},
					{
						"text": "For in the wrestling schools falls of the athletes are devoid of danger."
					},
					{
						"text": "For the wrestling is with friends, and they practice all their exercises on the persons of their teachers."
					},
					{
						"text": "But when the time of the contest has come, when the lists are open, when the spectators are seated above, when the president has arrived, it necessarily follows that the combatants, if they become careless, fall and retire in great disgrace, or if they are in earnest, win the crowns and the prizes."
					},
					{
						"text": "So then, in your case these thirty days are like some wrestling school, both for exercise and practice: let us learn from thence already to get the better of that evil demon."
					},
					{
						"text": "For it is to contend with him that we have to strip ourselves, with him after baptism are we to box and fight."
					},
					{
						"text": "Let us learn from thence already his grip, on what side he is aggressive, on what side he can easily threaten us, in order that, when the contest comes on, we may not feel strange, nor become confused, as seeing new forms of wrestling; but having already practiced them amongst ourselves, and having learnt all his methods, may engage in these forms of wrestling against him with courage."
					},
					{
						"text": "In all ways, therefore, is he accustomed to threaten us, but especially by means of the tongue, and the mouth."
					},
					{
						"text": "For there is no organ so convenient for him for our deception and our destruction as an unchastened tongue and an unchecked utterance."
					},
					{
						"text": "Hence come many slips on our part: hence many serious accusations against us."
					},
					{
						"text": "And the ease of these falls through the tongue a certain one showed, when he said, \"Many fell by the sword, but not so many as by the tongue\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Now the gravity of the fall the same person shows us again when he says: \"To slip upon a pavement is better than to slip with the tongue\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "And what he speaks of is of this kind."
					},
					{
						"text": "Better it is, says he, that the body should fall and be crushed, than that such a word should go forth as destroys the soul; and he does not speak of falls merely; he also admonishes us that much forethought should be exercised, so that we should not be tripped up, thus saying \"Make a door and bars for thy mouth,\" not that we should prepare doors and bars, but that with much security, we should shut the tongue off from outrageous words; and again in another place, after showing that we need influence from above, both as accompanying and preceding our own effort so as to keep this wild beast within: stretching forth his hands to God, the prophet said, \"Let the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice, set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, keep the door of my lips;\" and he who before admonished, himself too says again \"Who shall set a watch before my mouth, and a seal of wisdom upon my lips?\" Dost thou not see, each one fearing these falls and bewailing them, both giving advice, and praying that the tongue may have the benefit of much watchfulness? and for what reason, says one, if this organ brings us such ruin, did God originally place it within us? Because indeed, it is of great use, and if we are careful, it is of use only, and brings no ruin."
					},
					{
						"text": "Hear, for example, what he says who spoke the former words, \"Death and life are in the power of the tongue\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "And Christ points to the same thing when he says, \"By thy words thou shalt be condemned, and by thy words thou shalt be justified\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "For the tongue stands in the midst ready for use on either hand."
					},
					{
						"text": "Thou art its master."
					},
					{
						"text": "Thus indeed a sword lies in the midst, and if thou use it against thine enemies, this organ becomes a means of safety for thee."
					},
					{
						"text": "But if thou thrust its stroke against thyself, not the nature of the iron, but thine own transgression becomes the cause of thy slaughter."
					},
					{
						"text": "Let us then take this view of the tongue."
					},
					{
						"text": "It is a sword lying in the midst; sharpen it for the purpose of accusing thine own sins."
					},
					{
						"text": "Thrust not the stroke against thy brother."
					},
					{
						"text": "For this reason God surrounded it with a double fortification; with the fence of the teeth and the barrier of the lips, that it may not rashly and without circumspection utter words which are not convenient."
					},
					{
						"text": "Well, dost thou say it will not endure this? Bridle it therefore within."
					},
					{
						"text": "Restrain it by means of the teeth, as though giving over its body to these executioners and making them bite it."
					},
					{
						"text": "For it is better that when it sins now it should be bitten by the teeth, than one day when it seeks a drop of water and is parched with heat, to be unable to obtain this consolation."
					},
					{
						"text": "In many other ways indeed it is wont to sin, by raillery and blasphemy, by uttering foul words, by slander, swearing, and perjury."
					},
					{
						"text": "But in order that we may not by saying everything at once to-day, confuse your minds, we put before you one custom, namely, about the avoidance of oaths, saying this much by way of preface, and speaking plainly—that if you do not avoid oaths, I say not perjury merely, but those too which happen in the cause of justice, we shall not further discourse upon any other subject."
					},
					{
						"text": "For it is monstrous that teachers of letters should not give a second lesson to their children until they see the former one fixed well in their memory, but that we, without being able to express our first lessons clearly, should inculcate others before the first are completed."
					},
					{
						"text": "For this is nothing else than to pour into a perforated jar."
					},
					{
						"text": "Give great care, then, that ye silence not our mouth."
					},
					{
						"text": "For this error is grave, and it is exceedingly grave because it does not seem to be grave, and on this account I fear it, because no one fears it."
					},
					{
						"text": "On this account the disease is incurable, because it does not seem to be a disease; but just as simple speech is not a crime, so neither does this seem to be a crime, but with much boldness this transgression is committed: and if any one call it in question, straightway laughter follows, and much ridicule, not of those who are called in question for their oaths, but of those who wish to rectify the disease."
					},
					{
						"text": "On this account I largely extend my discourse about these matters."
					},
					{
						"text": "For I wish to pull up a deep root, and to wipe out a long-standing evil: I speak not of perjury alone, but even of oaths in good faith."
					},
					{
						"text": "But so and so, says one, a forbearing man, consecrated to the priesthood, living in much self-control and piety, takes an oath."
					},
					{
						"text": "Do not speak to me of this forbearing person, this self-controlled, pious man who is consecrated to the priesthood; but if thou wilt, add that this man is Peter, or Paul, or even an angel descended out of heaven."
					},
					{
						"text": "For not even in such a case do I regard the dignity of their persons."
					},
					{
						"text": "For the law which I read upon oaths, is not that of the servant, but of the King: and when the edicts of a king are read, let every claim of the servants be silent."
					},
					{
						"text": "But if thou art able to say that Christ bade us use oaths, or that Christ did not punish the doing of this, show me, and I am persuaded."
					},
					{
						"text": "But if he forbids it with so much care, and takes so much thought about the matter as to class him who takes an oath with the evil one (for whatsoever is more than these, namely, than yea and nay, saith he, is of the devil), why dost thou bring this person and that person forward? For not because of the carelessness of thy fellow servants, but from the injunctions of his own laws, will God record his vote against thee."
					},
					{
						"text": "I have commanded, he says, thou oughtest to obey, not to shelter thyself behind such and such a person and concern thyself with other persons' evil."
					},
					{
						"text": "Since the great David sinned a grievous sin, is it then safe for us to sin? Tell me: on this account then we ought to make sure of this point, and only to emulate the good works of the saints; and if there is carelessness, and transgression of the law anywhere, we ought to flee from it with great care."
					},
					{
						"text": "For our reckoning is not with our fellow-servants, but with our Master, and to him we shall give account for all done in our life."
					},
					{
						"text": "Let us prepare ourselves therefore for this tribunal."
					},
					{
						"text": "For even if he who transgresses this law be beyond everything revered and great, he shall certainly pay the penalty attaching to the transgression."
					},
					{
						"text": "For God is no respecter of persons."
					},
					{
						"text": "How then and in what way is it possible to flee from this sin? For one ought to show not only that the crime is grievous, but to give counsel how we may escape from it."
					},
					{
						"text": "Hast thou a wife, hast thou a servant, children, friends, acquaintance, neighbors? To all these enjoin caution on these matters."
					},
					{
						"text": "Custom is a grievous thing, terrible to supplant, and hard to guard against, and it often attacks us unwilling and unknowing; therefore in so far as thou knowest the power of custom, to such an extent study to be freed from any evil custom, and transfer thyself to any other most useful one."
					},
					{
						"text": "For as that custom is often able to trip thee up, though thou art careful, and guardest thyself, and takest thought, and consideration, so if thou transferrest thyself to the good custom of abstaining from oaths, thou wilt not be able, either involuntarily or carelessly, to fall into the fault of oaths."
					},
					{
						"text": "For custom is really great and has the power of nature."
					},
					{
						"text": "In order then that we do not continually distress ourselves let us transfer ourselves to another custom, and ask thou each one of thy kindred and acquaintance this favor, that he advise thee and exhort thee to flee from oaths, and reprove thee, when detected in them."
					},
					{
						"text": "For the watch over thee which takes place on their part, is to them too counsel and a suggestion to what is right."
					},
					{
						"text": "For he who reproves another for oaths, will not himself easily fall into this pit."
					},
					{
						"text": "For much swearing is no ordinary pit, not only when it is about little matters but about the greatest."
					},
					{
						"text": "And we, whether buying vegetables, or quarrelling over two farthings, or in a rage with our servants and threatening them, always call upon God as our witness."
					},
					{
						"text": "But a freeman, possessed of some barren dignity, thou wouldest not dare to call upon as witness in the market to such things; but even if thou attemptedst it, thou wilt pay the penalty of thine insolence."
					},
					{
						"text": "But the King of Heaven, the Lord of Angels, when disputing both about purchases and money, and what not, thou draggest in for a testimony."
					},
					{
						"text": "And how can these things be borne? whence then should we escape from this evil custom? After setting those guards of which I spoke round us, let us fix on a specified time to ourselves for amendment, and adding thereto condemnation if, when the time has passed, we have not amended this."
					},
					{
						"text": "How long time will suffice for the purpose? I do not think that they who are very wary, and on the alert, and watchful about their own salvation, should need more than ten days, so as to be altogether free from the evil custom of oaths."

For this reason I said before, and speak now and will not cease speaking, if any has not rectified the defects in his morals, nor furnished himself with easily acquired virtue, let him not be baptized."

Thou hast injured thyself in regard to thy soul, for for the words which thou hast said thou art about to render account there; and this I wish you to know chiefly of all, that the Christian, and faithful man, no one is able to injure in regard to the soul, not even the devil himself; and not only is this wonderful, that God hath made us inaccessible to all his designs, but that he has constituted us fit for the practice of virtue, and there is no hinderance, if we will, even though we be poor, weak in body, outcast, nameless, bondservants."
					},
					{
						"text": "For neither poverty, nor infirmity, nor deformity of body, nor servitude, nor any other of such things could ever become a hinderance to virtue; and why do I say, poor, and a bondservant, and nameless? Even if thou art a prisoner, not even this would be ever any hinderance to thee as regards virtue."

						"text": "Show all meekness, forbearance, self-restraint, gravity."
					},
					{
						"text": "For these things need no external helps."
					},
					{
						"text": "And this especially is the chief point about virtue, that it has no necessity for wealth, power, glory, nor anything of that kind, but of a sanctified soul alone, and it seeks for nothing more."
					},
					{
						"text": "And behold, also, the same thing happening in respect of grace."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if any one be lame, if he has had his eyes put out, if he be maimed in body, if he has fallen into the last extremity of weakness, grace is not hindered from coming by any of these things."
					},
					{
						"text": "For it only seeks a soul receiving it with readiness, and all these external things it passes over."
					},
					{
						"text": "For in the case of worldly soldiers, those who are about to enlist them for the army seek for stature of body and healthy condition, and it is not only necessary that he who is about to become a soldier should have these alone, but he must also be free."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if anybody be a slave, he is rejected."
					},
					{
						"text": "But the King of Heaven seeks for nothing of this kind, but receives slaves into his army, and aged people, and the languid in limb, and is not ashamed."
					},
					{
						"text": "What is more merciful than this? What could be more kind? For he seeks for what is in our own power, but they seek for what is not in our power."
					},
					{
						"text": "For to be a slave or free is not our doing."
					},
					{
						"text": "To be tall, again, or short is not in our own power, or to be aged, or well grown, and such like."
					},
					{
						"text": "But to be forbearing and kind, and so forth, are matters of our own choice; and God demands of us only those things of which we have control."
					},
					{
						"text": "And quite reasonably."
					},
					{
						"text": "For He does not call us to grace because of his own need, but because of doing us kindness; but kings, because of services required by them; and they carry men off to an outward and material warfare, but He to a spiritual combat; and it is not only in the case of heathen wars, but in the case of the games also that one may see the same analogy."
					},
					{
						"text": "For they who are about to be brought into the theatre, do not descend to the contest until the herald himself takes them beneath the gaze of all, and leads them round, shouting out and saying, \"Has any one a charge against this person?\" although in that case the struggle is not concerned with the soul, but with the body."
					},
					{
						"text": "Wherefore then dost thou demand proofs of nobleness? But in this case there is nothing of the kind, but all is different, our contest not consisting of hand locked in hand, but in philosophy of soul, and excellence of mind."
					},
					{
						"text": "The president of our conflicts does the opposite."
					},
					{
						"text": "For he does not take us, and lead us round and say, \"Has any one a charge against this man?\" but cries out, \"Though all men, though demons, stand up with the devil and accuse him of extreme and unspeakable crimes, I reject him not, nor abhor him, but removing him from his accusers, and freeing him from his wickedness, thus I bring him to the contest."
					},
					{

					},
					{
						"text": "And not only is this the wonderful thing that he remits our sins, but that he not even reveals them nor makes them manifest and patent, nor compels us to come forward into the midst, and to tell out our errors, but bids us make our defense to him alone, and to confess ourselves to him."
					},
					{
						"text": "And yet among secular judges, if any tell any of the robbers or grave-riflers, when they are arrested, to tell their errors and be quit of their punishment, they would accede to this with all readiness, despising the shame through desire of safety."
					},
					{
						"text": "But in this case there is nothing of this kind, but he both remits the sins, nor compels us to marshal them in array before any spectators."

					},
					{

While we wonder then at his kindliness, let us show forth our doings, and before all others let us curb the vehemence of our tongue, and not always be giving utterance."

					},
					{
						"text": "In this case thou shalt undergo nothing serious, but shalt be able to sit in thy workshop as in a monastery."

					{
						"text": "Do not thou therefore say, How can I, being a handicraftsman and a poor man, be a philosopher? This is indeed the very reason why thou mayest be a philosopher."
					},
					{
						"text": "For poverty is far more conducive to piety for us than wealth, and work than idleness; since wealth is even a hinderance to those who do not take heed."
					},
					{
						"text": "For when it is needful to dismiss anger, to extinguish envy, to curb passion, to offer prayer, to exhibit forbearance and meekness, kindliness and charity, when would poverty be a bar? For it is not possible by spending money to accomplish these things, but by exhibiting a right disposition; almsgiving especially needs money, but even it shines forth in greater degree through poverty."
					},
					{
						"text": "For she who spent the two mites was poorer than all men, and yet surpassed all."
					},
					{
						"text": "Let us not then consider wealth to be anything great, nor gold to be better than clay."
					},
					{
						"text": "For the value of material things is not owing to their nature, but to our estimate of them."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if any one would inquire carefully, iron is much more necessary than gold."
					},
					{
						"text": "For the one contributes to no need of our life, but the other has furnished us with the greater part of our needs, ministering to countless arts; and why do I speak of a comparison between gold and iron? For these stones are more necessary than precious stones."
					},

					{
						"text": "For the other kind of adorning is wont to plunge him into a suspicion of jealousy, and into enmity, quarrelsomeness and strife, for nothing is more annoying than a face which is suspected."
					},
					{
						"text": "But the ornament of compassion and modesty casts out all evil suspicion, and will draw thy partner to thee more strongly than any bond."
					},
					{
						"text": "For natural beauty does not impart such comeliness to the face as does the disposition of him who beholds it, and nothing is so wont to produce that disposition as modesty and dignity; so that if any woman be comely, and her husband be ill affected towards her, she appears to him the most worthless of all women; and if she do not happen to be fair of face, but her husband be well affected towards her, she appears more comely than all."
					},
					{
						"text": "For sentence is given not according to the nature of what is beheld, but according to the disposition of the beholders."

But why is it necessary to speak of that day, since it is possible to show all this from what happens now."

So that they are in no way unjustly treated, both their evil being cut off by their punishment, and their chastening is to be lighter there, because they suffered here beforehand."

And how is it that Paul marvels at Him on account of this declaration, saying \"Who being in the form of God counted it not a prize to be on an equality with God, but emptied Himself taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the cross\"."

For this reason, just as He hungered, as He slept, as He felt fatigue, as He ate and drank, so also did He deprecate death, thereby manifesting his humanity, and that infirmity of human nature which does not submit without pain to be torn from this present life."

Yes, but it is one thing to make statements which are diverse, and another, statements which are contradictory; for the former causes no discord or strife: but that which is now presented to us is a strong case of contradiction unless it be proved that the paralytic at the pool was a different man from him who is described by the other three evangelists."

					},
					{

Because that which is manifest presents the proof in a more distinct form."

					{
						"text": "Therefore He did not enable the man to rise until He had said to them \"But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith He to the sick of the palsy) arise and walk:\" as if He had said: forgiveness of sins is indeed a greater sign: but for your sakes I add the less also since this seems to you to be a proof of the other."
					},
					{
						"text": "For as in another case when He praised the centurion for saying \"speak the word only and my servant shall be healed: for I also say to this man go and he goeth and to the other come and he cometh,\" He confirmed his opinion by the eulogy which He pronounced: and again when He reproved the Jews for finding fault with Him on the Sabbath day saying that He transgressed the law, He proved that He had authority to alter laws: even so in this instance also when some said \"He maketh Himself equal with God by promising that which belongs only to the Father,\" He having upbraided and accused them and proved by His deeds that He did not blaspheme supplied us with indisputable evidence that He could do the same things as the Father who begat Him."
					},

And just as when men beholding from the land those who are shipwrecked, are deeply distressed, but are not able to approach and to rescue the drowning, so too here, the mothers restrained through fear of the soldiers, as it were by so many waves, not only dared not go near to their children, and rescue them from condemnation, but were afraid even to shed tears?."

Truly now is the season to proclaim, \"Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord? who can show forth all His praise?\" How many men have not only cast down, but also trodden under foot the images of God!

For these things, assuredly, it were right to rejoice, and to be thankful to God, that by the terror of a few days He hath put an end to such stupidity!  \"Very true,\" saith some one, \"if our danger did not go beyond fear, we should have reaped a sufficient benefit; but we are now in dread lest the mischief should proceed much farther, and we should be all placed in the extremest peril\"."

When therefore thou hearest that, \"In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth,\" run not hastily over the declaration; but traverse in thy mind the breadth of the earth; and reflect how He hath spread out so sumptuous and exquisite a table for us, and provided us with such abundant gladness."

What proof did he give of regard for thee, like that which I have done? Did I not make for thee the heaven, the earth, the sea, the sun, the moon, and all the stars? For truly none of the angels needed this work of creation; but for thee, and for thy recreation, I made so great and excellent a world; and didst thou esteem mere words alone, a false engagement, and a promise full of deceit, as more worthy to be believed than the kindness and providence that was manifested by deeds; that thou gavest thyself over to him, and didst trample My laws under foot!\" These words, and more of this kind, one who had been treated contemptuously would probably say."

But of these records we will speak at a befitting season; before that, however, it is necessary to state at what time this Book was given; for these things were not written in the beginning, nor at once when Adam was made, but many generations afterwards; and it were worth while to enquire for what reason this delay took place, and why at length they were given to the Jews only, and not to all men; and why written in the Hebrew tongue; and why in the wilderness of Sinai? For the Apostle doth not mention the place merely in a cursory manner; but shews that in that circumstance too there was a great subject of contemplation for us, when he saith to us: \"For these are two covenants, the one from Mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage\"."

And if it be necessary to take the book of the Gospel, thou receivest it with hands that have been first washed; and fearfully and tremblingly, with much reverence and devotion; and dost thou unceremoniously bandy about upon thy tongue the Lord of the Gospel? Dost thou desire to learn how the Powers above pronounce that Name; with what awe, with what terror, with what wonder? \"I saw the Lord,\" saith the prophet, \"sitting upon a throne, high, and lifted up; around Him stood the Seraphim; and one cried unto another, and said, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Sabaoth; the whole earth is full of His glory!\" Perceivest thou, with what dread, with what awe, they pronounce that Name, whilst glorifying and praising Him? But thou, in thy prayers and supplications, callest upon Him with much listlessness; when it would become thee to be full of awe, and to be watchful and sober! But in oaths, where it is wholly unsuitable that this wonderful Name should be introduced, there thou makest a long string of divers forms of imprecation! What pardon then, or what excuse shall we have, howsoever we may plead this \"custom\"? It is said, that a certain heathen orator, by a kind of foolish habit, was continually moving his right shoulder as he went along."

Do thou too, then, act thus with regard to thy tongue, and instead of the knife, suspend over it the fear of God's chastisement, and thou wilt assuredly get the better! For it seems impossible, utterly impossible, that those should ever be overcome, who are solicitous and earnest about this, and really make it their business."

And this, when we are neither called upon to pay down money; nor to give others any trouble; nor to sustain any sufferings; but without any of all these things, by only choosing and willing, have it in our power to accomplish the entire amendment of it; and knowing assuredly that if we fail to do this, we shall sustain the extreme sentence, and punishments, and penalties, which are inexorable! For tell me, if any one promised to teach thee the healing art in a short space of time, without money or labour, wouldest thou not think him a benefactor? Wouldest thou not submit both to do and to suffer all things, whatsoever he who promised these things commanded? Behold, now, it is permitted thee without labour to find a medicine for wounds, not of the body, but of the soul, and to restore it to a state of health, without any suffering! Let us not be indifferent to the matter! For pray what is the pain of laying aside anger against one who hath aggrieved thee? It is a pain, indeed, to remember injuries, and not to be reconciled! What labour is it to pray, and to ask for a thousand good things from God, who is ready to give? What labour is it, not to speak evil of any one? What difficulty is there in being delivered from envy and ill-will? What trouble is it to love one's neighbour? What suffering is it not to utter shameful words, nor to revile, nor to insult another?

Tell me not then of tears and rheums, for these things are the fruit of thy sin; but consider its beauty, and visual power; and how it is that whilst it ranges over such an expanse of air, it experiences no weariness or distress!

					},
					{
						"text": "Thus, the advantage which swiftness affords to the horse, intelligence and art afford to the man in a much greater excess."
					},
					{
						"text": "The man, it is true, has not feet so strong as the other, but then he has those of the other which serve him as well as his own."
					},
					{
						"text": "For not one of the brutes has ever been able to subjugate another to his own use; but man has the range of them all; and by that variety of skill which is given him of God, makes each of the animals subservient to the employment best suited to him."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if the feet of men had been as strong as those of horses, they would have been useless for other purposes, for difficult ground, for the summits of mountains, for climbing trees; for the hoof is usually an impediment to treading in such places."
					},

					},
					{
						"text": "Again, the irrational animals have their weapons in their own body; thus, the ox has his horns; the wild boar his tusks; the lion his claws."

					},
					{
						"text": "In order then that I might be free and unfettered in this matter, not being at all times compelled to carry my weapons, He hath made these to be separate from my nature."
					},
					{
						"text": "For it is not only in our possessing a rational nature that we surpass the brutes, but we also excel them in body."
					},
					{
						"text": "For God has made this to correspond with the soul's nobility, and fitted to execute its commands."
					},
					{
						"text": "He has not, indeed, made the body such as it is, without reason; but such as it ought to be, as having to minister to a rational soul; so that if it were not such as it is, the operations of the soul would be greatly impeded: and this is manifest from diseases."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if this nice adjustment of the body be diverted from its proper condition in ever so small a degree, many of the soul's energies are impeded; as, for instance, if the brain should become too hot, or too cold."
					},
					{
						"text": "So that from the body it is easy to see much of the Divine Providence, not only because He made it at first better than it is at present; nor because even now He hath changed it for a useful purpose, but also because He will raise it again to much greater glory."
					},
					{
						"text": "But, if thou art desirous to learn in a different way what wisdom God hath shewn respecting the body, I will mention that by which Paul seems most especially to be constantly struck."
					},
					{
						"text": "But what is this? That He hath made the members to excel one another, though not in the same things? Some He hath appointed to surpass the rest in beauty, and some in strength."
					},
					{
						"text": "Thus, the eye is beautiful, but the feet are stronger."
					},
					{
						"text": "The head is honourable, but it cannot say to the feet, \"I have no need of you\"."

					},
					{
						"text": "The king, for instance, has need of his subjects, and the subjects of the king; just as the head has need of the feet."
					},
					{
						"text": "And again, as to brutes; some are more powerful than the rest; and some more beautiful."
					},
					{
						"text": "Some there are that delight us; some that nourish; and some that clothe us."
					},
					{
						"text": "Thus the peacock delights; and fowls and swine nourish; sheep and goats provide us clothing; and the ox and ass share our labours."
					},
					{
						"text": "There are also others which provide us with none of these, but which call our powers into active exercise."
					},
					{
						"text": "Thus the wild animals increase the strength of the hunters; and instruct our race by the fear which they inspire, and render us more cautious; and for medical purposes, they supply no small contributions from their bodies."
					},

Why then did He not make it thus from the beginning, asks some one? It was, I reply, to justify Himself before thee by these very works; and as much as to say by the result itself, \"I called thee to greater honour, but thou didst constitute thyself unworthy of the gift, banishing thyself from Paradise!

How shall we be partakers of those wonderful mysteries by means of the same tongue with which we have trampled upon God's law, the same tongue with which we have contaminated the soul? For if no one would dare to receive the royal purple with filthy hands, how shall we receive the Lord's Body with a tongue that has become polluted!

Or if thou hast any other advantage, become useful to those who require the benefit of thy labours! Seest thou not that for this reason, especially, the bee is more honoured than the other animals; not because she labours, but because she labours for others? For the spider also labours, and toils, and spreads out his fine textures over the walls, surpassing the utmost skill of woman; but the creature is without estimation, since his work is in no way profitable to us; such are they that labour and toil, but for themselves!

					},
					{
						"text": "Wherefore that man knew sin to be an evil thing, Adam manifested; and that he knew that virtue was a good thing, Abel again made evident."
					},
					{
						"text": "For without having learnt it from any one, without having heard any law promulgated respecting the first fruits, but having been taught from within, and from his conscience, he presented that sacrifice."

					},
					{
						"text": "And from thence again the knowledge of conscience is apparent."

					{
						"text": "The outward guise was one thing, the pretence of love; the thought another, the purpose of fratricide."

And again, after the murder had been perpetrated, being asked of God, \"Where is Abel thy brother?\" he answers, \"I know not; Am I my brother's keeper?\" Wherefore does he deny the crime? Is it not evidently because he exceedingly condemns himself."

					},
					{
						"text": "For Paul too, when he was engaged in controversy with such persons, entered upon this head."
					},

						"text": "For the men now living may perchance have learned them from their elders; and they from those who were before them, and these again from those beyond? But from whom did those learn who were the originators and first enactors of laws among them? Is it not evident that it was from conscience? For they cannot say, that they held communication with Moses; or that they heard the prophets."
					},
					{
						"text": "How could it be so when they were Gentiles? But it is evident that from the very law which God placed in man when He formed him from the beginning, laws were laid down, and arts discovered, and all other things."

					},
					{
						"text": "So also came there to be courts of justice, and so were penalties defined, as Paul accordingly observes."
					},
					{
						"text": "For since many of the Gentiles were ready to controvert this, and to say, \"How will God judge mankind who lived before Moses? He did not send a lawgiver; He did not introduce a law; He commissioned no prophet, nor apostle, nor evangelist; how then can He call these to account?\" Since Paul therefore wished to prove that they possessed a self taught law; and that they knew clearly what they ought to do; hear how he speaks; \"For when the Gentiles who have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these having not the law, are a law unto themselves; which shew the work of the law written in their hearts\"."

						"text": "And again; \"But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile\"."

						"text": "But these things he spake in reference to the early times, before the coming of Christ; and the Gentile he names here is not an idolater, but one who worshipped God only; unfettered by the necessity of Judaical observances, (I mean Sabbaths, and circumcision, and divers purifications,) yet exhibiting all manner of wisdom and piety."

					},

						"text": "If, then, he had not heard the law, nor conversed with the Jews, how could there be wrath, indignation and tribulation against him for working evil? The reason is, that he possessed a conscience inwardly admonishing him, and teaching him, and instructing him in all things."
					},
					{
						"text": "Whence is this manifest? From the way in which he punished others when they did amiss; from the way in which he laid down laws; from the way in which he set up the tribunals of justice."

For suppose that thou and another person have alike been guilty of adultery."

And if thou correctest the sins of others, how will not God correct thee? And though He may not bring the punishment upon thee instantly, be not confident on that account, but fear the more."

						"text": "Exposition on the subject of the creation of man, and of his having received a natural law."
					},
					{
						"text": "Of the complete accomplishment of abstinence from oaths."
					},
					{
						"text": "With the same introduction and prelude that I began yesterday and the day before, I shall begin to-day."
					},
					{
						"text": "Now again I will say, \"Blessed be God!\" What a day did we see last Wednesday! and what in the present! On that day how heavy was the gloom! How bright the calm of the present! That was the day when that fearful tribunal was set in the city, and shook the hearts of all, and made the day to seem no better than night; not because the beams of the sun were extinguished, but because that despondency and fear darkened your eyes."
					},
					{
						"text": "Wherefore, that we may reap the more pleasure, I wish to relate a few of the circumstances which then occurred; for I perceive that a narrative of these things will be serviceable to you, and to all who shall come afterwards."
					},
					{
						"text": "Besides, to those who have been delivered from shipwreck, it is sweet to remember the waves, and the tempest, and the winds, when they are come into port."
					},
					{
						"text": "And to those who have fallen into sickness, it is an agreeable thing, when the sickness is over, to talk over with others the fevers by which they were nearly brought to the grave."
					},
					{
						"text": "When terrors have passed away, there is a pleasure in relating those terrors; the soul no longer fearing them, but deriving therefrom more cheerfulness."
					},
					{
						"text": "The remembrance of past evils always makes the present prosperity to appear more strikingly."
					},
					{
						"text": "When the greater portion of the city had taken refuge from the fear and danger of that occasion, in secret places, in deserts, and in hollows; terror besetting them in all directions; and the houses were empty of women, and the forum of men, and scarce two or three appeared walking together across it, and even these going about as if they had been animated corpses: at this period, I proceeded to the tribunal of justice, for the purpose of seeing the end of these transactions; and there, beholding the fragments of the city collected together, I marvelled most of all at this, that although a multitude was around the doors, there was the profoundest silence, as though there had been no man there, all looking upon one another; not one daring to enquire of his neighbour, nor to hear anything from him; for each regarded his neighbour with suspicion; since many already, having been dragged away, beyond all expectation, from the midst of the forum, were now confined within."
					},
					{
						"text": "Thus we all alike looked up to heaven, and stretched out our hands in silence, expecting help from above, and beseeching God to stand by those who were brought to judgment, to soften the hearts of the judges, and to make their sentence a merciful one."
					},
					{
						"text": "And just as when some persons on land, beholding others suffering shipwreck, cannot indeed go near to them, and reach out the hand, and relieve their distress, being kept back from them by the waves; yet away on the shore, with outstretched hands and tears, they supplicate God that He may help the drowning; so there in like manner, did all silently and mentally call upon God, pleading for those at the tribunal, as for men surrounded by the waves, that He would stretch out His hand, and not suffer the vessel to be overwhelmed, nor the judgment of those under trial to end in an utter wreck."
					},
					{
						"text": "Such was the state of things in front of the doors; but when I entered within the court, other sights I saw which were still more awful; soldiers armed with swords and clubs, and strictly keeping the peace for the judges within."
					},
					{
						"text": "For since all the relatives of those under trial, whether wives, or mothers, or daughters, or fathers, stood before the doors of the seat of justice; in order that if any one happened to be led away to execution, yet no one inflamed at the sight of the calamity might raise any tumult or disturbance; the soldiers drove them all afar off; thus preoccupying their mind with fear."
					},
					{
						"text": "One sight there was, more pitiable than all; a mother, and a sister of a certain person, who was among those under trial within, sat at the very vestibule of the court of justice, rolling themselves on the pavement, and becoming a common spectacle to all the bystanders; veiling their faces, and shewing no sense of shame, but that which the urgency of the calamity permitted."
					},
					{
						"text": "No maid servant, nor neighbour, nor female friend, nor any other relative accompanied them."
					},
					{
						"text": "But hemmed in by a crowd of soldiers, alone, and meanly clad, and grovelling on the ground, about the very doors, they were in more pitiable case than those who were undergoing judgment within, and hearing as they did the voice of the executioners, the strokes of the scourge, the wailing of those who were being scourged, the fearful threats of the judges, they themselves endured, at every scourging, sharper pains than those who were beaten."
					},
					{
						"text": "For since, in the confessions of others, there was a danger of accusations being proved, if they heard any one scourged that he might mention those who were guilty, and uttering cries, they, looking up to heaven, besought God to give the sufferer some strength of endurance, lest the safety of their own relations should be betrayed by the weakness of others, while incapable of sustaining the sharp anguish of the strokes."
					},
					{
						"text": "And again, the same thing occurred as in the case of men who are struggling with a tempest."
					},
					{
						"text": "For just as when they perceive the violence of a wave lifting up its head from afar, and gradually increasing, and ready to overwhelm the vessel, they are almost dead with terror, before it comes near the ship; so also was it with these."
					},
					{
						"text": "If at any time they heard voices, and cries that reached them, they saw a thousand deaths before their eyes, being in terror, lest those who were urged to bear witness, giving way to their torments, should name some one of those who were their own relatives."
					},
					{
						"text": "And thus, one saw tortures both within and without."
					},
					{
						"text": "Those within the executioners were tormenting; these women, the despotic force of nature, and the sympathy of the affections."
					},
					{
						"text": "There was lamentation within, and without! inside, on the part of those who were found guilty, and outside on the part of their relatives."
					},
					{
						"text": "Yea, rather not these only, but their very judges inwardly lamented, and suffered more severely than all the rest; being compelled to take part in so bitter a tragedy."
					},
					{
						"text": "As for me, while I sat and beheld all this, how matrons and virgins, wont to live in seclusion, were now made a common spectacle to all; and how those who were accustomed to lie on a soft couch, had now the pavement for their bed; and how they who had enjoyed so constant an attendance of female servants and eunuchs, and every sort of outward distinction, were now bereft of all these things; and grovelling at the feet of every one, beseeching him to lend help by any means in his power to those who were undergoing examination, and that there might be a kind of general contribution of mercy from all; I exclaimed, in those words of Solomon, \"Vanity of vanities, all is vanity\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "For I saw both this and another oracle fulfilled in every deed, which saith, \"All the glory of man is as the flower of grass."
					},
					{
						"text": "The grass withereth, and the flower falleth away\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "For then indeed, wealth, and nobility, and notoriety, and the patronage of friends, and kinship and all worldly things, were found worthless; the sin, and transgression of the law which had taken place, having put all these succours to flight."
					},
					{
						"text": "And just as the mother of young birds, when the nestlings have been carried away, coming and finding her nest empty, is unable to rescue her captive brood; but by hovering around the hands of the fowler, in this way displays her grief; even so did these women then do, when their children were snatched away from their dwellings, and shut up within, as it were in a net, or a trap."
					},
					{
						"text": "They could not indeed come in and deliver the prisoners, but they manifested their anguish by wallowing on the ground near the very doors; by lamentation and groans; and by endeavouring to approach as near as possible to those who had captured them."
					},
					{
						"text": "These things then beholding, I cast in my mind That Dread Tribunal; and I said within myself, \"If now, when men are the judges, neither mother, nor sister, nor father, nor any other person, though guiltless of the deeds which have been perpetrated, can avail to rescue the criminals; who will stand by us when we are judged at the dread Tribunal of Christ? Who will dare to raise his voice? Who will be able to rescue those who shall be led away to those unbearable punishments."
					},
					{
						"text": "Notwithstanding they were the first men of the city who were then brought to trial, and the very chief of the nobility, yet they would have been glad if it could be granted them to lose all their possessions, yea, if need were, their liberty itself, so that they might continue to enjoy this present life."
					},
					{
						"text": "But to proceed."
					},
					{
						"text": "The day now hastening to its close, and late evening arriving, and the final sentence of the court being expected, all were in still greater agony, and besought God that He would grant some delay and respite; and incline the soul of the judges to refer the facts that had been investigated to the decision of the Emperor; since perchance some advantage might arise from this reference."
					},
					{
						"text": "Moreover, by the people general supplications were sent up to the Merciful God; imploring that He would save the remnants of the city; and not suffer it entirely to be razed from its foundations."
					},

					},
					{
						"text": "At last having loaded the culprits with chains, and bound them with iron, they sent them away to the prison through the midst of the forum."
					},
					{
						"text": "Men that had kept their studs of horses, who had been presidents of the games, who could reckon up a thousand different offices of distinction which they had held, had their goods confiscated, and seals might be seen placed upon all their doors."
					},
					{
						"text": "Their wives also being ejected from their parents' home, each had literally to play the part of Job's wife."
					},
					{
						"text": "For they went \"wandering from house to house and from place to place, seeking a lodging\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "And this it was not easy for them to find, every one fearing and trembling to receive, or to render assistance in any way to the relatives of those who were under impeachment."
					},
					{
						"text": "Nevertheless, though such events had happened, the sufferers were patient under all; since they were not deprived of the present life."
					},
					{
						"text": "And neither the loss of wealth, nor dishonour, nor so much public exposure, nor any other matter of that nature, caused them vexation."
					},
					{
						"text": "For the greatness of the calamity, and the circumstance of their having expected still worse things, when they suffered these, had prepared the soul for the exercise of a wise fortitude."
					},
					{
						"text": "And now they learnt, how simple a thing is virtue for us, how easy and expeditious of performance, and that from our neglect only it seems to be laborious."
					},
					{
						"text": "They who before this time could not bear the loss of a little money with meekness, now they were subject to a greater fear, although they had lost all their substance, felt as if they had found a treasure, because they had not lost their lives."
					},
					{
						"text": "So that if the sense of a future hell took possession of us, and we thought of those intolerable punishments, we should not grieve, even though for the sake of the law of God we were to give both our substance, and our bodies and lives too, knowing that we should gain greater things; deliverance from the terrors that are hereafter."
					},
					{
						"text": "Perchance the tragedy of all I have told you, has greatly softened your hearts."
					},
					{
						"text": "Do not however take it amiss."
					},
					{
						"text": "For since I am about to venture upon some more subtle thoughts and require a more sensitive state of mind on your part, I have done this intentionally, in order that by the terror of the description your minds might have shaken off all listlessness, and withdrawn themselves from all worldly cares, and might with the more readiness convey the force of the things about to be spoken into the depths of your soul."
					},
					{
						"text": "Sufficiently indeed, then, our discourse of late evinced to you, that a natural law of good and evil is seated within us."
					},
					{
						"text": "But that our proof of it may be more abundantly evident, we will again to-day apply ourselves strenuously to the same subject of discourse."
					},
					{
						"text": "For that God from the beginning, when He formed man, made him capable of discriminating both these, all men make evident."
					},
					{
						"text": "Hence when we sin, we are all ashamed at the presence of our inferiors; and oftentimes a master, on his way to the house of a harlot, if he then perceives any one of his more respectable servants, turns back, reddening with shame, from this untoward path."
					},
					{
						"text": "Again, when others reproach us, fixing on us the names of particular vices, we call it an insult; and if we are aggrieved, we drag those who have done the wrong to the public tribunal."
					},
					{
						"text": "Thus we can understand what vice is and what virtue is."
					},
					{
						"text": "Wherefore Christ, for the purpose of declaring this, and shewing that He was not introducing a strange law, or one which surpassed our nature, but that which He had of old deposited beforehand in our conscience, after pronouncing those numerous Beatitudes, thus speaks; \"All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "\"Many words,\" saith He, \"are not necessary, nor laws of great length, nor a diversity of instruction."
					},
					{
						"text": "Let thine own will be the law."
					},
					{
						"text": "Dost thou wish to receive kindness? Be kind to another."
					},
					{
						"text": "Dost thou wish to receive mercy? Show mercy to thy neighbour."
					},
					{
						"text": "Dost thou wish to be applauded? Applaud another."
					},
					{
						"text": "Dost thou wish to be beloved? Exercise love."
					},
					{
						"text": "Dost thou wish to enjoy the first rank? First concede that place to another."
					},
					{
						"text": "Become thyself the judge, thyself the lawgiver of thine own life."
					},
					{
						"text": "And again; \"Do not to another what thou hatest\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "By the latter precept, he would induce to a departure from iniquity; by the former, to the exercise of virtue."
					},
					{
						"text": "\"Do not thou to another,\" he saith, \"what thou hatest\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Dost thou hate to be insulted? Do not insult another."

					{
						"text": "Dost thou hate to be envied? Envy not another."
					},
					{
						"text": "Dost thou hate to be deceived? Do not deceive another."
					},
					{
						"text": "And, in a word, in all things, if we hold fast these two precepts, we shall not need any other instruction."
					},
					{
						"text": "For the knowledge of virtue He hath implanted in our nature; but the practice of it and the correction He hath entrusted to our moral choice."
					},
					{
						"text": "Perhaps what is thus said, is obscure; wherefore I will again endeavour to make it more plain."
					},
					{
						"text": "In order to know that it is a good thing to exercise temperance, we need no words, nor instruction; for we ourselves have the knowledge of it in our nature, and there is no necessity for labour or fatigue in going about and enquiring whether temperance is good and profitable; but we all acknowledge this with one consent, and no man is in doubt as to this virtue."
					},
					{
						"text": "So also we account adultery to be an evil thing, and neither is there here any need of trouble or learning, that the wickedness of this sin may be known; but we are all self-taught in such judgments; and we applaud virtue, though we do not follow it; as, on the other hand, we hate vice, though we practise it."
					},
					{
						"text": "And this hath been an exceeding good work of God; that He hath made our conscience, and our power of choice already, and before the action, claim kindred with virtue, and be at enmity with wickedness."
					},
					{
						"text": "As I said then, the knowledge of each of these things resides within the conscience of all men, and we require no teacher to instruct us in these things; but the regulation of our conduct is left to our choice, and earnestness, and efforts."
					},
					{
						"text": "And why was this? but because if He had made everything to be of nature, we should have departed uncrowned and destitute of reward; and even as the brutes, who receive no reward nor praise for those advantages which they have naturally, so neither should we enjoy any of these things; for natural advantages are not the praise and commendation of those who have them, but of the Giver."
					},
					{
						"text": "For this reason, then, He did not commit all to nature; and again, He did not suffer our will to undertake the whole burden of knowledge, and of right regulation; lest it should despair at the labour of virtue."
					},
					{
						"text": "But conscience suggests to it what ought to be done; and it contributes its own exertions for the accomplishment."
					},
					{
						"text": "That it is a good thing to be temperate, we all understand without difficulty; for the knowledge is of nature: but we should not be able without difficulty, without bridling lust, and employing much exertion, to practise the rule of temperance; for this does not come to us by nature as the knowledge does, but requires also a willing mind and earnestness."
					},
					{
						"text": "And not only in this respect has He made the burden lighter for us, but also in another way again, by letting even some good dispositions exist naturally within us."
					},
					{
						"text": "For we are all naturally disposed to feel indignation along with those who are contemptuously treated, (whence it arises that we become the enemies of those who are insolent, though we ourselves may have suffered no part of the grievance,) and to sympathize in the pleasure of those who enjoy assistance and protection; and we are overcome by the calamities of others, as well as by mutual tenderness."
					},
					{
						"text": "For although calamitous events may seem to induce a certain pusillanimity, we entertain nevertheless a common fondness for each other."
					},
					{
						"text": "And to this effect a certain wise man speaks significantly; \"Every animal loveth his like, and man his neighbour\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "But God hath provided many other instructors for us besides conscience; viz."
					},
					{
						"text": ", fathers for children, masters for servants, husbands for wives, teachers for pupils, law-givers and judges for those who are to be governed, and friends for friends."
					},
					{
						"text": "And frequently too we gain no less from enemies than friends; for when the former reproach us with our offences, they stir us up, even against our will, to the amendment of them."
					},
					{
						"text": "So many teachers hath He set over us, in order that the discovery of what is profitable, and the regulation of our conduct, might be easy to us, the multitude of those things which urge us on toward it not permitting us to fall away from what is expedient for us."
					},
					{
						"text": "For although we should despise parents, yet while we fear magistrates, we shall in any case be more submissive than otherwise."
					},
					{
						"text": "And though we may set them at nought when we sin, we can never escape the rebuke of conscience: and if we dishonour and repel this, yet whilst fearing the opinion of the many, we shall be the better for it."
					},
					{
						"text": "And though we are destitute of shame with regard to this, the fear of the laws will press on us so as to restrain us, however reluctantly."
					},
					{
						"text": "Thus fathers and teachers take the young in hand, and bring them into order; and lawgivers and magistrates, those who are grown up."
					},
					{
						"text": "And servants, as being more inclined to listlessness, in addition to what has been previously mentioned, have their masters to constrain them to temperance; and wives have their husbands."
					},
					{
						"text": "And many are the walls which environ our race on all sides, lest it should too easily slide away, and fall into wickedness."
					},
					{
						"text": "Beside all these too; sicknesses and calamities instruct us."
					},
					{
						"text": "For poverty restrains, and losses sober us, and danger subdues us, and there are many other things of this sort."
					},
					{
						"text": "Doth neither father, nor teacher, nor prince, nor lawgiver, nor judge make thee fear? Doth no friend move thee to shame, nor enemy sting thee? Doth no master chastise? Doth no husband instruct? Doth no conscience correct thee? Still, when bodily sickness comes, it often sets all right; and a loss has made the audacious man to become gentle."
					},
					{
						"text": "And what is more than this, heavy misfortunes, which befal not only ourselves but others too, are often of great advantage to us; and we who ourselves suffered nothing, yet beholding others enduring punishment, have been no less sobered by it than they."
					},
					{
						"text": "And with respect to right deeds, any one may see that this happens; for as when the bad are punished others become better, so whenever the good achieve any thing right, many are urged onward to a similar zeal: a thing which hath also taken place with respect to the avoiding of oaths."
					},
					{
						"text": "For many persons, observing that others had laid aside the evil practice of oaths, took a pattern from their diligence, and got the better of the sin; wherefore we are the more disposed to touch again on the subject of this admonition."
					},
					{
						"text": "For let no one tell me that \"many\" have accomplished this; this is not what is desired, but that \"all\" should do so; and until I see this I cannot take breath."
					},
					{
						"text": "That Shepherd had a hundred sheep, and yet when one of them had wandered away, he took no account of the safety of the ninety and nine, until he found the one that was lost, and restored it again to the flock."
					},
					{
						"text": "Seest thou not that this also happens with respect to the body; for if by striking against any obstacle, we have only turned back a nail, the whole body sympathizes with the member."
					},
					{
						"text": "Say not this; that only a certain few have failed; but consider this point, that these few being unreformed, will corrupt many others."
					},
					{
						"text": "Although there was but one who had committed fornication among the Corinthians, yet Paul so groaned as if the whole city were lost."
					},
					{
						"text": "And very reasonably, for he knew that if that member were not chastened, the disease progressing onward would at length attack all the rest."
					},
					{
						"text": "I saw, but lately, in the court of justice, those distinguished men bound and conducted through the forum; and while some were wondering at this extraordinary degradation, others said there was nothing to wonder at; for that, where there is matter of treason, rank must go for nothing."
					},
					{
						"text": "Is it not then much more true that rank must be of no avail where is impiety?."
					},
					{
						"text": "Thinking therefore of these things, let us arouse ourselves; for if ye bring not your own endeavours to the task, every thing on our part is to no purpose."
					},
					{
						"text": "And why so? Because it is not with the office of teaching, as it is with other arts."
					},
					{
						"text": "For the silversmith, when he has fabricated a vessel of any kind, and laid it aside, will find it on the morrow just as he left it."
					},
					{
						"text": "And the worker in brass, and the stone-cutter, and every other artificer, will each again take his own work in hand, whatever it is, just in the state he quitted it."
					},
					{
						"text": "But it is not so with us, but altogether the reverse; for we have not lifeless vessels to forge, but reasonable souls."
					},
					{
						"text": "Therefore we do not find you such as we leave you, but when we have taken you, and with manifold labour moulded, reformed you and increased your ardour on your departing from this place, the urgency of business, besetting you on every side, again perverts you, and causes us increased difficulty."
					},
					{
						"text": "Therefore, I supplicate and beseech you to put your own hand to the work; and when ye depart hence, to shew the same earnest regard for your own safety, that I have here shewn for your amendment."
					},
					{
						"text": "Oh! that it were possible that I could perform good works as your substitute, and that you could receive the rewards of those works! Then I would not give you so much trouble."
					},
					{
						"text": "But how can I do this? The thing is impossible; for to every man will He render according to his own works."
					},
					{
						"text": "Wherefore as a mother, when she beholds her son in a fever, while she witnesses his sufferings from choking and inflammation, frequently bewails him, and says to him, \"O my son, would that I could sustain thy fever, and draw off its flame upon myself!\" so now I say, Oh! that by labouring as your substitute, I could do good works for you all! But no, this is not to be done."
					},
					{
						"text": "But of his own doings must each man give the account, and one cannot see one person suffer punishment in the room of another."
					},
					{
						"text": "For this reason I am pained and mourn, that on That Day, when ye are called to judgment, I shall not be able to assist you, since, to say the truth, no such confidence of speech with God belongs to me."
					},
					{
						"text": "But even if I had much confidence, I am not holier than Moses, or more righteous than Samuel; of whom it is said, that though they had attained to so great virtue, they could not in any way avail to assist the Jews; inasmuch as that people had given themselves over to excessive negligence."
					},
					{
						"text": "Since, then, from our own works we shall be punished or saved; let us endeavour, I beseech you, in conjunction with all the other precepts, to fulfill this one; that, finally departing this life with a favourable hope, we may obtain those good things which are promised, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom and with Whom, to the Father, with the Holy Ghost, be glory both now and ever, world without end, Amen."

And when the tyrant was publicly rebuked in the hearing of all, he bore the censure nobly; but when he had thrown himself into the fatal necessity caused by oaths, then he cut off that blessed head."

For when it was needful that he should have refreshed those who were fatigued and exhausted, and have sent them forth with renewed vigour against their enemies, he treated them far worse than he had done their enemies, by the constraint of an oath, which delivered them over to excessive hunger."
					},
					{
						"text": "Dangerous, indeed, it is for any one to swear in a matter pertaining to himself; for we are forcibly impelled to do many things by the urgency of circumstances."

					},

If any one had then proposed to thee to remain \"a year\" without the bath, so that thou mightest be rescued from the impending distress, wouldest thou not readily have accepted the proposal, and submitted to it? When, therefore, it were becoming that thou shouldest give thanks to God, Who hath freed thee from all these things without any loss, dost thou again grow wanton and contemptuous; and when the fear has passed away, turn back afresh to a worse state of negligence? Have these dire events really touched thee, and yet art thou so desirous of the baths? Why, if the bath had been permitted, would not the calamity of those who are yet in confinement have been sufficient to persuade those who are not in the same grievous condition to be forgetful of every luxury? Life itself is at stake, and dost thou remember the baths, and desire to be luxurious? Dost thou despise the danger because thou hast now escaped it?

When thou discoursest with a friend, thou givest heed to what thou art doing, but when waiting on God on account of thy sins, and asking pardon for so many offences, and thinking that thou shalt obtain forgiveness, thou art often listless; and whilst thy knees are lying on the ground, thou sufferest thy mind to wander every where, in the market, or in the house, babbling the while with thy mouth vainly and to no purpose!

For what can be more bitter, than when we are found to have unjustly provoked our benefactor, and one who loved us so much, and the whole world knows it, and condemns us for the most monstrous ingratitude! If Barbarians had made an incursion on our city, and razed its walls, and burnt its houses, and had taken and carried us away captive, the evil had been less."

						"text": "But now, having been deprived of your favour, and having quenched your love, which was a greater security to us than any wall, whom have we left to fly to? Where else shall we have to look, when we have provoked so benign a lord, so indulgent a father? So that while they seem to have committed offences of the most intolerable kind, they have on the other hand suffered the most terrible evils; not daring to look any man in the face; nor being able to look upon the sun with free eyes; shame everywhere weighing down their eyelids, and compelling them to hide their heads! Deprived of their confidence, they are now in a more miserable condition than any captives, and undergo the utmost dishonour; and whilst thinking of the magnitude of their evils, and the height of insolence to which they have rushed, they can scarce draw breath; inasmuch as they have drawn on their own heads severer reproaches from all the inhabitants of the world, than even from him who is seen to have been insulted."
					},

						"text": "But yet, O Emperor, if you are willing, there is a remedy for the wound, and a medicine for these evils, mighty as they are! Often, indeed, has it occurred amongst private individuals, that great and insufferable offences have become a foundation for great affection."

Nay, though it is a strange thing, I must say, display towards us now still greater kindness than ever; and again write this city's name among the foremost in your love;—if you are indeed desirous of being revenged upon the demons who were the instigators of these crimes! For if you pull down, and overturn, and raze the city, you will be doing those very things which they have long been desiring."

						"text": "And you would be just in acting thus, and in shewing mercy to a city, which the demons envied on account of your affection; for if you had not so exceedingly loved her, they would not have envied her to such a degree! So that even if what I have asserted is extraordinary, it is nevertheless, true, that what the city hath suffered, hath been owing to thee, and thy love! What burning, what devastation, so bitter as those words, which you uttered in your own defence?."

For this diadem is a display of your princely virtue, but it is also a token of the munificence of him who gave it; but the crown woven from this your humanity will be entirely your own good work, and that of your own love of wisdom; and all men will admire you less for the sake of these precious stones, than they will applaud you for your superiority over this wrath."

Every man will thus set you up in his own soul; and you will have as many statues, as there are men who now inhabit, or shall hereafter inhabit, the whole world! For not only we, but all those who come after us, and their successors, will hear of these things, and will admire and love you, just as if they themselves had experienced this kindness!."

Many and great titles did he build, and many barbarous tribes did he conquer; not one of which we now remember; but this saying is repeated over and over again, to the present day; and those who follow us, as well as those who come after them, will all hear of it."
					},
					{
						"text": "Nor indeed is this the only admirable thing; that they will hear of it; but that when men speak of it, they do so with approbation and applause; and those who hear of it, receive it with the like; and there is no one who, when he has heard it, is able to remain silent, but each at once cries out, and applauds the man who uttered it, and prays that innumerable blessings may be his lot even now deceased."

					},
					{
						"text": "Behold the season of recalling and restoring the deceased, and bringing them back to former life! For these are indeed already dead, even before the sentence hath been pronounced; and the city hath now taken up its tabernacle at the very gates of Hades! Therefore raise it up again, which you can do without money, without expense, without loss of time or labour! It is sufficient merely for you to open your lips, and you will restore to life the city which at present lieth in darkness."

						"text": "That, many of the Emperors have frequently done; but should you alone accomplish this, you will be first in doing it, and that beyond all expectation."
					},
					{
						"text": "And the former of these good deeds, the protection of your subjects, is not at all wonderful or extraordinary; but is one of those events which are of continual occurrence; but the latter, the dismissal of wrath after the endurance of such provocations, is something which surpasses human nature."

Great indeed must be the God of the Christians, who makes angels out of men, and renders them superior to all the constraining force of our nature!\"."

If they had been ordered to be put to death, they would not have suffered as much as they do now, living as they have done so many days in fear and trembling; and when the evening approaches, not expecting to behold the morning; nor when the day arrives, hoping to reach the evening! Many too have fallen in with wild beasts, while pursuing their way through desert places, and removing to untrodden spots; and not men only, but also little children and women; free born, and of good condition; hiding themselves many days and nights in caves, and ravines, and holes of the desert! A new mode of captivity hath indeed befallen the city."

Whilst no barbarian foe is present, whilst no enemy appears, they are more wretchedly situated than if actually taken; and the rustling only of a leaf scares them all every day! And these are matters which are universally known; so that if all men had seen the city razed to the ground, they would not have been taught such a lesson of sobriety, as by hearing of the calamities which have now befallen it."

						"text": "For to punish the guilty, and to exact the penalty for these deeds, were easy and open to any one; but to spare those who have insulted you, and to pardon those who have committed offences undeserving of pardon, is an act of which only some one or two are capable; and especially so, where the person treated with indignity is the Emperor."

					{
						"text": "It is an easy matter to place the city under the subjection of fear; but to dispose all to be loving subjects; and to persuade them to hold themselves well affected towards your government; and to offer not only their common, but individual prayers for your empire; is a work of difficulty."
					},

						"text": "How much money, how many labours would you not have expended to win over to yourself the whole world in a short space of time; and to be able to persuade all those men who are now in existence, as well as all future generations, to invoke upon your head the same blessings which they pray for on behalf of their own children! And if you will receive such a reward from men, how much greater will you have from God! And this, not merely from the events which are now taking place, but from those good deeds which shall be performed by others in time to come."

					{
						"text": "For if ever it should be that an event similar to what has now occurred should take place, (which God forbid!) and any of those who have been treated with indignity, should then be consulting about prosecuting measures against the rioters; your gentleness and moral wisdom will serve them instead of all other teaching and admonition; and they will blush and be ashamed, having such an example of wisdom, to appear inferior."
					},
					{
						"text": "So that in this way you will be an instructor to all posterity; and you will obtain the palm amongst them, even although they should attain to the highest point of moral wisdom! For it is not the same thing for a person to set the first example of such meekness himself and by looking at others, to imitate the good actions they have performed."
					},

					},
					{
						"text": "And supposing that no such person should come into being, the tribute of commendation and applause will be accumulating to you throughout every age."

						"text": "For consider, what it is for all posterity to hear it reported, that when so great a city had become obnoxious to punishment and vengeance, that when all were terrified, when its generals, its magistrates and judges, were all in horror and alarm, and did not dare to utter a word on behalf of the wretched people; a single old man, invested with the priesthood of God, came and moved the heart of the Monarch by his mere aspect and intercourse; and that the favour which he bestowed upon no other of his subjects, he granted to this one old man, being actuated by a reverence for God's laws! For in this very thing, O Emperor, that I have been sent hither on this embassy, the city hath done you no small honour; for they have thus pronounced the best and the most honourable judgment on you, which is, that you respect the priests of God, however insignificant they may be, more than any office placed under your authority!."
					},

And do not confound our hopes, nor defeat our promises."

					},
					{
						"text": "He was not, however, able to conceal the feeling at the close of the conference; but betrayed himself, though against his will."
					},
					{

					},
					{
						"text": "And what was that? \"How, said he, \"can it be any thing wonderful or great, that we should remit our anger against those who have treated us with indignity; we, who ourselves are but men; when the Lord of the universe, having come as He did on earth, and having been made a servant for us, and crucified by those who had experienced His kindness, besought the Father on behalf of His crucifiers, saying, \"Forgive them, for they know not what they do?\" What marvel, then, if we also should forgive our fellow-servants! And that these words were not a pretence was proved by all that followed."
					},
					{
						"text": "And not the least, that particular circumstance which I am now about to mention; for this our priest, when he would have remained there, and celebrated the feast together with himself, he urged, though contrary to what he would have wished,—to use all speed, and diligence, to present himself to his fellow-citizens."
					},

If they see the helmsman, they will no longer remember the storm that has passed away; but all recollection of these sorrowful events will be effaced!\" And when the Priest was urgent, entreating him to send his own son, he, wishing to give the most satisfactory proof of his having entirely blotted out from his soul every wrathful feeling, answered; \"Pray that these hindrances may be taken out of the way; that these wars may be put an end to; and then I will certainly come myself\"."
					},

						"text": "What could be gentler than such a soul? Let the Gentiles henceforward be ashamed; or rather, instead of being ashamed, let them be instructed; and leaving their native error, let them come back to the strength of Christianity, having learned what our philosophy is, from the example of the Emperor and of the Priest! For our most pious Emperor stayed not at this point; but when the Bishop had left the city, and come over the sea, he dispatched thither also certain persons, being most solicitous and painstaking to prevent any waste of time lest the city should be thus deprived of half its pleasure, whilst the bishop was celebrating the feast beyond its walls."

					},

For the history of what has lately happened to us, will have power to profit not only ourselves, if we constantly remember it, but also those who shall come after us."
