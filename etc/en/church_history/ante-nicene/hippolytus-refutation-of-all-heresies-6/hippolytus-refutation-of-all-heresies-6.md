# Hippolytus: Refutation of All Heresies VI

**[1:1]** Refutation of All Heresies Book : Heresy Compared to  the Stormy Ocean,  the Rocks of the Sirens; Moral from Ulysses and the Sirens.

**[1:2]** The pupils of these men, when they perceive the doctrines of the heretics to be like unto the ocean when tossed into waves by violence of the winds, ought to sail past in quest of the tranquil haven.

**[1:3]** For a sea of this description is both infested with wild beasts and difficult of navigation, like, as we may say, the Sicilian (Sea), in which the legend reports were Cyclops, and Charybdis, and Scylla, and the rock of the Sirens.

**[1:4]** Now, the poets of the Greeks allege that Ulysses sailed through (this channel), adroitly using (to his own purpose) the terribleness of these strange monsters.

**[1:5]** For the savage cruelty (in the aspect) of these towards those who were sailing through was remarkable.

**[1:6]** The Sirens, however, singing sweetly and harmoniously, beguiled the voyagers, luring, by reason of their melodious voice, those who heard it, to steer their vessels towards (the promontory).

**[1:7]** The (poets) report that Ulysses, on ascertaining this, smeared with wax the ears of his companions, and, lashing himself to the mast, sailed, free of danger, past the Sirens, hearing their chant distinctly.

**[1:8]** And my advice to my readers is to adopt a similar expedient, viz.

**[1:9]** , either on account of their infirmity to smear their ears with wax, and sail (straight on) through the tenets of the heretics, not even listening to (doctrines) that are easily capable of enticing them into pleasure, like the luscious lay of the Sirens, or, by binding one's self to the Cross of Christ, (and) hearkening with fidelity (to His words), not to be distracted, inasmuch as he has reposed his trust in Him to whom ere this he has been firmly knit, and (I admonish that man) to continue stedfastly (in this faith).

**[2:1]** The System of Basilides Derived from Aristotle.

**[2:2]** Since, therefore, in the six books preceding this, we have explained previous (heretical opinions), it now seems proper not to be silent respecting the (doctrines) of Basilides, which are the tenets of Aristotle the Stagyrite, not (those) of Christ.

**[2:3]** But even though on a former occasion the opinions propounded by Aristotle have been elucidated, we shall not even now scruple to set them down beforehand in a sort of synopsis, for the purpose of enabling my readers, by means of a nearer comparison of the two systems, to perceive with facility that the doctrines advanced by Basilides are (in reality) the clever quibbles of Aristotle.

**[3:1]** Sketch of Aristotle's Philosophy.

**[3:2]** Aristotle, then, makes a threefold division of substance.

**[3:3]** For one portion of it is a certain genus, and another a certain species, as that (philosopher) expresses it, and a third a certain individual.

**[3:4]** What is individual, however, (is so) not through any minuteness of body, but because by nature it cannot admit of any division whatsoever.

**[3:5]** The genus, on the other hand, is a sort of aggregate, made up of many and different germs.

**[3:6]** And from this genus, just as (from) a certain heap, all the species of existent things derive their distinctions.

**[3:7]** And the genus constitutes a competent cause for (the production of) all generated entities.

**[3:8]** In order, however, that the foregoing statement may be clear, I shall prove (my position) through an example.

**[3:9]** And by means of this it will be possible for us to retrace our steps over the entire speculation of the Peripatetic (sage).

**[4:1]** Aristotle's General Idea.

**[4:2]** We affirm the existence of animal absolutely, not some animal.

**[4:3]** And this animal is neither ox, nor horse, nor man, nor god; nor is it significant of any of these at all, but is animal absolutely.

**[4:4]** From this animal the species of all particular animals derive their subsistence.

**[4:5]** And this animality, itself the summum genus, constitutes (the originating principle) for all animals produced in those (particular) species, and (yet is) not (itself any one) of the things generated.

**[4:6]** For man is an animal deriving the principle (of existence) from that animality, and horse is an animal deriving the principle of existence from that animality.

**[4:7]** The horse, and ox, and dog, and each of the rest of the animals, derive the principle (of existence) from the absolute animal, while animality itself is not any of these.

**[5:1]** Nonentity as a Cause.

**[5:2]** If, however, this animality is not any of these (species), the subsistence, according to Aristotle, of the things that are generated, derived its reality from non-existent entities.

**[5:3]** For animality, from whence these singly have been derived, is not any one (of them); and though it is not any one of them, it has yet become some one originating principle of existing things.

**[5:4]** But who it is that has established this substance as an originating cause of what is subsequently produced, we shall declare when we arrive at the proper place for entertaining a discussion of this sort.

**[6:1]** Substance, According to Aristotle; The Predicates.

**[6:2]** Since, however, as I have stated, substance is threefold, viz.

**[6:3]** , genus, species, (and) individual; and (since) we have set down animality as being the genus, and man the species, as being already distinct from the majority of animals, but notwithstanding still to be identified (with animals of his own kind), inasmuch as not being yet moulded into a species of realized substance,—(therefore it is, that) when I impart form under a name to a man derived from the genus, I style him Socrates or Diogenes, or some one of the many denominations (in use).

**[6:4]** And since (in this way, I repeat,) I comprehend under a name the man who constitutes a species that is generated from the genus, I denominate a substance of this description individual.

**[6:5]** For genus has been divided into species, and species into individual.

**[6:6]** But (as regards) the individual, since it has been comprehended under a name, it is not possible that, according to its own nature, it could be divided into anything else, as we have divided each of the fore-mentioned (genus and species).

**[6:7]** Aristotle primarily, and especially, and preeminently entitles this—substance, inasmuch as it cannot either be predicated of any Subject, or exist in a Subject.

**[6:8]** He, however, predicates of the Subject, just as with the genus, what I said constituted animality, (and which is) predicated by means of a common name of all particular animals, such as ox, horse, and the rest that are placed under (this genus).

**[6:9]** For it is true to say that man is an animal, and horse an animal, and that ox is an animal, and each of the rest.

**[6:10]** Now the meaning of the expression "predicated of a Subject" is this, that inasmuch as it is one, it can be predicated in like manner of many (particulars), even though these happen to be diversified in species.

**[6:11]** For neither does horse nor ox differ from man so far forth as he is an animal, for the definition of animal is said to suit all animals alike.

**[6:12]** For what is an animal? If we define it, a general definition will comprehend all animals.

**[6:13]** For animal is an animated Substance, endued with Sensation.

**[6:14]** Such are ox, man, horse, and each of the rest (of the animal kingdom).

**[6:15]** But the meaning of the expression "in a Subject" is this, that what is inherent in anything, not as a part, it is impossible should exist separately from that in which it is.

**[6:16]** But this constitutes each of the accidents (resident) in Substance, and is what is termed Quality.

**[6:17]** Now, according to this, we say that certain persons are of such a quality; for instance, white, grey, black, just, unjust, temperate, and other (characteristics) similar to these.

**[6:18]** But it is impossible for any one of these to subsist itself by itself; but it must inhere in something else.

**[6:19]** If, however, neither animal which I predicate of all individual animals, nor accidents which are discoverable in all things of which they are nonessential qualities, can subsist themselves by themselves, and (yet if) individuals are formed out of these, (it follows, therefore, that) the triply divided Substance, which is not made up out of other things, consists of nonentities.

**[6:20]** If, then, what is primarily, and pre-eminently, and particularly denominated Substance consists of these, it derives existence from nonentities, according to Aristotle.

**[7:1]** Aristotle's Cosmogony; His "Psychology;" His "Entelecheia;" His Theology; His Ethics; Basilides Follows Aristotle.

**[7:2]** But concerning Substance, the statements now made will suffice.

**[7:3]** But not only is Substance denominated genus, species, (and) individual, but also matter, and form, and privation.

**[7:4]** There is, however, (as regards the substance,) in these no difference, even though the division be allowed to stand.

**[7:5]** Now, inasmuch as Substance is of this description, the arrangement of the world has taken place according to some such plan as the following.

**[7:6]** The world is divided, according to Aristotle, into very numerous and diversified parts.

**[7:7]** Now the portion of the world which extends from the earth to the moon is devoid of foresight, guideless, and is under the sway of that nature alone which belongs to itself.

**[7:8]** But another (part of the world which lies) beyond the moon, and extends to the surface of heaven, is arranged in the midst of all order and foresight and governance.

**[7:9]** Now, the (celestial) superficies constitutes a certain fifth substance, and is remote from all those natural elements out of which the cosmical system derives consistence.

**[7:10]** And this is a certain fifth Substance, according to Aristotle,—as it were, a certain super-mundane essence.

**[7:11]** And (this essence) has become (a logical necessity) in his system, in order to accord with the (Peripatetic) division of the world.

**[7:12]** And (the topic of this fifth nature) constitutes a distinct investigation in philosophy.

**[7:13]** For there is extant a certain disquisition, styled A Lecture on Physical (Phenomena), in which he has elaborately treated concerning the operations which are conducted by nature and not providence, (in the quarter of space extending) from the earth as far as the moon.

**[7:14]** And there is also extant by him a certain other peculiar treatise on the principles of things (in the region) beyond the moon, and it bears the following inscription: Metaphysics.

**[7:15]** And another peculiar dissertation has been (written) by him, entitled Concerning a Fifth Substance, and in this work Aristotle unfolds his theological opinions.

**[7:16]** There exists some such division of the universe as we have now attempted to delineate in outline, and (corresponding with it is the division) of the Aristotelian philosophy.

**[7:17]** His work, however, (styled) Concerning the Soul, is obscure.

**[7:18]** For in the entire three books (where he treats of this subject) it is not possible to say clearly what is Aristotle's opinion concerning the soul.

**[7:19]** For, as regards the definition which he furnishes of soul, it is easy (enough) to declare this; but what it is that is signified by the definition is difficult to discover.

**[7:20]** For soul, he says, is an entelecheia of a natural organic body; (but to explain) what this is at all, would require a very great number of arguments and a lengthened investigation.

**[7:21]** As regards, however, the Deity, the Originator of all those glorious objects in creation, (the nature of) this (First Cause)—even to one conducting his speculations by a more prolonged inquiry than that concerning (the soul)—is more difficult to know than the soul itself.

**[7:22]** The definition, however, which Aristotle furnishes of the Deity is, I admit, not difficult to ascertain, but it is impossible to comprehend the meaning of it.

**[7:23]** For, he says, (the Deity) is a "conception of conception;" but this is altogether a non-existent (entity).

**[7:24]** The world, however, is incorruptible (and) eternal, according to Aristotle.

**[7:25]** For it has in itself nothing faulty, inasmuch as it is directed by Providence and Nature.

**[7:26]** And Aristotle has laid down doctrines not only concerning Nature and a cosmical system, and Providence, and God, but he has written (more than this); for there is extant by him likewise a certain treatise on ethical subjects, and these he inscribes Books of Ethics.

**[7:27]** But throughout these he aims at rendering the habits of his hearers excellent from being worthless.

**[7:28]** When, therefore, Basilides has been discovered, not in spirit alone, but also in the actual expressions and names, transferring the tenets of Aristotle into our evangelical and saving doctrine, what remains, but that, by restoring what he has appropriated from others, we should prove to the disciples of this (heretic) that Christ will in no wise profit them, inasmuch as they are heathenish?.

**[8:1]** Basilides and Isidorus Allege Apostolic Sanction for Their Systems; They Really Follow Aristotle.

**[8:2]** Basilides, therefore, and Isidorus, the true son and disciple of Basilides, say that Matthias communicated to them secret discourses, which, I being specially instructed, he heard from the Saviour.

**[8:3]** Let us, then, see how clearly Basilides, simultaneously with Isidorus, and the entire band of these (heretics), not only absolutely belies Matthias, but even the Saviour Himself.

**[8:4]** (Time) was, says (Basilides), when there was nothing.

**[8:5]** Not even, however, did that nothing constitute anything of existent things; but, to express myself undisguisedly and candidly, and without any quibbling, it is altogether nothing.

**[8:6]** But when, he says, I employ the expression "was," I do not say that it was; but (I speak in this way) in order to signify the meaning of what I wish to elucidate.

**[8:7]** I affirm then, he says, that it was "altogether nothing".

**[8:8]** For, he says, that is not absolutely ineffable which is named (so),—although undoubtedly we call this ineffable,—but that which is "non-ineffable".

**[8:9]** For that which is "non-ineffable" is not denominated ineffable, but is, he says, above every name that is named.

**[8:10]** For, he says, by no means for the world are these names sufficient, but so manifold are its divisions that there is a deficiency (of names).

**[8:11]** And I do not take it upon myself to discover, he says, proper denominations for all things.

**[8:12]** Undoubtedly, however, one ought mentally, not by means of names, to conceive, after an ineffable manner, the peculiarities (of things) denominated.

**[8:13]** For an equivocal terminology, (when employed by teachers,) has created for their pupils confusion and a source of error concerning objects.

**[8:14]** (The Basilidians), in the first instance, laying hold on this borrowed and furtively derived tenet from the Peripatetic (sage), play upon the folly of those who herd together with them.

**[8:15]** For Aristotle, born many generations before Basilides, first lays down a system in The Categories concerning homonymous words.

**[8:16]** And these heretics bring this (system) to light as if it were peculiarly their own, and as if it were some novel (doctrine), and some secret disclosure from the discourses of Matthias.

**[9:1]** Basilides Adopts the Aristotelian Doctrine of "Nonentity".

**[9:2]** Since, therefore, "nothing" existed,—(I mean) not matter, nor substance, nor what is insubstantial, nor is absolute, nor composite, (nor conceivable, nor inconceivable, (nor what is sensible,) nor devoid of senses, nor man, nor angel, nor a god, nor, in short, any of those objects that have names, or are apprehended by sense, or that are cognised by intellect, but (are) thus (cognised), even with greater minuteness, still, when all things are absolutely removed,—(since, I say, "nothing" existed,) God, "non-existent,"—whom Aristotle styles "conception of conception," but these (Basilidians) "non-existent,"—inconceivably, insensibly, indeterminately, involuntarily, impassively, (and) unactuated by desire, willed to create a world.

**[9:3]** Now I employ, he says, the expression "willed" for the purpose of signifying (that he did so) involuntarily, and inconceivably, and insensibly.

**[9:4]** And by the expression "world" I do not mean that which was subsequently formed according to breadth and division, and which stood apart; nay, (far from this,) for (I mean) the germ of a world.

**[9:5]** The germ, however, of the world had all things in itself.

**[9:6]** Just as the grain of mustard comprises all things simultaneously, holding them (collected) together within the very smallest (compass), viz.

**[9:7]** , roots, stem, branches, leaves, and innumerable gains which are produced from the plant, (as) seeds again of other plants, and frequently of others (still), that are produced (from them).

**[9:8]** In this way, "non-existent" God made the world out of nonentities, casting and depositing some one Seed that contained in itself a conglomeration of the germs of the world.

**[9:9]** But in order that I may render more clear what it is those (heretics) affirm, (I shall mention the following illustration of theirs.

**[9:10]** ) As an egg of some variegated and particoloured bird,—for instance the peacock, or some other (bird) still more manifold and particoloured,—being one in reality, contains in itself numerous forms of manifold, and particoloured, and much compounded substances; so, he says, the nonexistent seed of the world, which has been deposited by the non-existent God, constitutes at the same time the germ of a multitude of forms and a multitude of substances.

**[10:1]** Origin of the World; Basilides' Account of the "Sonship".

**[10:2]** All things, therefore whatsoever it is possible to declare, and whatever, being not as yet discovered, one must omit, were likely to receive adaptation to the world which was about to be generated from the Seed.

**[10:3]** And this (Seed), at the requisite seasons, increases in bulk in a peculiar manner, according to accession, as through the instrumentality of a Deity so great, and of this description.

**[10:4]** (But this Deity) the creature can neither express nor grasp by perception.

**[10:5]** (Now, all these things) were inherent, treasured in the Seed, as we afterwards observe in a new-born child the growth of teeth, and paternal substance, and intellect, and everything which, though previously having no existence, accrues unto a man, growing little by little, from a youthful period of life.

**[10:6]** But since it would be absurd to say that any projection of a non-existent God became anything non-existent (for Basilides altogether shuns and dreads the Substances of things generated in the way of projection for, (he asks,) of what sort of projection is there a necessity, or of what sort of matter must we assume the previous existence, in order that God should construct a world, as the spider his web; or (as) a mortal man, for the purpose of working it, takes a (piece of) brass or of wood, or some other of the parts of matter?),—(projection, I say, being out of the question,) certainly, says (Basilides), God spoke the word, and it was carried into effect.

**[10:7]** And this, as these men assert, is that which has been stated by Moses: "Let there be light, and there was light".

**[10:8]** Whence he says, came the light? From nothing.

**[10:9]** For it has not been written, he says, whence, but this only, (that it came) from the voice of him who speaks the word.

**[10:10]** And he who speaks the word, he says, was non-existent; nor was that existent which was being produced.

**[10:11]** The seed of the cosmical system was generated, he says, from nonentities; (and I mean by the seed,) the word which was spoken, "Let there be light".

**[10:12]** And this, he says, is that which has been stated in the Gospels: "He was the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world".

**[10:13]** He derives his originating principles from that Seed, and obtains from the same source his illuminating power.

**[10:14]** This is that seed which has in itself the entire conglomeration of germs.

**[10:15]** And Aristotle affirms this to be genius, and it is distributed by him into infinite species; just as from animal, which is non-existent, we sever ox, horse, (and) man.

**[10:16]** When, therefore, the cosmical Seed becomes the basis (for a subsequent development), those (heretics) assert, (to quote Basilides' own words:) "Whatsoever I affirm," he says, "to have been made after these, ask no question as to whence.

**[10:17]** For (the Seed) had all seeds treasured and reposing in itself, just as non-existent entities, and which were designed to be produced by a non-existent Deity".

**[10:18]** Let us see, therefore, what they say is first, or what second, or what third, (in the development of) what is generated from the cosmical Seed.

**[10:19]** There existed, he says, in the Seed itself, a Sonship, threefold, in every respect of the same Substance with the non-existent God, (and) begotten from nonentities.

**[10:20]** Of this Sonship (thus) involving a threefold division, one part was refined, (another gross,) and another requiring purification.

**[10:21]** The refined portion, therefore, in the first place, simultaneously with the earliest deposition of the Seed by the non-existent one, immediately burst forth and went upwards and hurried above from below, employing a sort of velocity described in poetry,—  "…As wing or thought,"—  and attained, he says, unto him that is nonexistent.

**[10:22]** For every nature desires that (nonexistent one), on account of a superabundance of beauty and bloom.

**[10:23]** Each (nature desires this), however, after a different mode.

**[10:24]** The more gross portion, however, (of the Sonship) continuing still in the Seed, (and) being a certain imitative (principle), was not able to hurry upwards.

**[10:25]** For (this portion) was much more deficient in the refinement that the Sonship possessed, which through itself hurried upwards, (and so the more gross portion) was left behind.

**[10:26]** Therefore the more gross Sonship equipped itself with some such wing as Plato, the Preceptor of Aristotle, fastens on the soul in (his) Phaedrus.

**[10:27]** And Basilides styles such, not a wing, but Holy Spirit; and Sonship invested in this (Spirit) confers benefits, and receives them in turn.

**[10:28]** He confers benefits, because, as a wing of a bird, when removed from the bird, would not of itself soar high up and aloft; nor, again, would a bird, when disengaged from its pinion, at any time soar high up and aloft; (so, in like manner,) the Sonship involved some such relation in reference to the Holy Spirit, and the Spirit in reference to the Sonship.

**[10:29]** For the Sonship, carried upwards by the Spirit as by a wing, bears aloft (in turn) its pinion, that is, the Spirit.

**[10:30]** And it approaches the refined Sonship, and the non-existent God, even Him who fabricated the world out of nonentities.

**[10:31]** He was not, (however,) able to have this (spirit) with (the Sonship) itself; for it was not of the same substance (with God), nor has it (any) nature (in common) with the Sonship.

**[10:32]** But as pure and dry air is contrary to (their) nature, and destructive to fishes; so, in contrariety to the nature of the Holy Spirit, was that place simultaneously of non-existent Deity and Sonship,—(a place) more ineffable than ineffable (entities), and higher up than all names.

**[10:33]** Sonship, therefore, left this (spirit) near that Blessed Place, which cannot be conceived or represented by any expression.

**[10:34]** (He left the spirit) not altogether deserted or separated from the Sonship; nay, (far from it,) for it is just as when a most fragrant ointment is put into a vessel, that, even though (the vessel) be emptied (of it) with ever so much care, nevertheless some odour of the ointment still remains, and is left behind, even after (the ointment) is separated from the vessel; and the vessel retains an odour of ointment, though (it contain) not the ointment (itself).

**[10:35]** So the Holy Spirit has continued without any share in the Sonship, and separated (from it), and has in itself, similarly with ointment, its own power, a savour of Sonship.

**[10:36]** And this is what has been declared: "As the ointment upon the head which descended to the beard of Aaron".

**[10:37]** This is the savour from the Holy Spirit borne down from above, as far as formlessness, and the interval (of space) in the vicinity of our world.

**[10:38]** And from this the Son began to ascend, sustained as it were, says (Basilides), upon eagles' wings, and upon the back.

**[10:39]** For, he says, all (entities) hasten upwards from below, from things inferior to those that are superior.

**[10:40]** For not one of those things that are among things superior, is so silly as to descend beneath.

**[10:41]** The third Sonship, however, that which requires purification, has continued, he says, in the vast conglomeration of all germs conferring benefits and receiving them.

**[10:42]** But in what manner it is that (the third Sonship) receives benefits and confers them, we shall afterwards declare when we come to the proper place for discussing this question.

**[11:1]** The "Great Archon" Of Basilides.

**[11:2]** When, therefore, a first and second ascension of the Sonship took place, and the Holy Spirit itself also remained after the mode mentioned, the firmament was placed between the super-mundane (spaces) and the world.

**[11:3]** For existing things were distributed by Basilides into two continuous and primary divisions, and are, according to him, denominated partly in a certain (respect) world, and partly in a certain (respect) super-mundane (spaces).

**[11:4]** But the spirit, a line of demarcation between the world and super-mundane (spaces), is that which is both holy, and has abiding in itself the savour of Sonship.

**[11:5]** While, therefore, the firmament which is above the heaven is coming into existence, there burst forth, and was begotten from the cosmical Seed, and the conglomeration of all germs, the Great Archon (and) Head of the world, (who constitutes) a certain (species of) beauty, and magnitude, and indissoluble power.

**[11:6]** For, says he, he is more ineffable than ineffable entities, and more potent than potent ones, and more wise than wise ones, and superior to all the beautiful ones whatever you could mention.

**[11:7]** This (Archon), when begotten, raised Himself up and soared aloft, and was carried up entire as far as the firmament.

**[11:8]** And there He paused, supposing the firmament to be the termination of His ascension and elevation, and considering that there existed nothing at all beyond these.

**[11:9]** And than all the subjacent (entities) whatsoever there were among them which remained mundane, He became more wise, more powerful, more comely, more lustrous, (in fact,) pre-eminent for beauty above any entities you could mention with the exception of the Sonship alone, which is still left in the (conglomeration of) all germs.

**[11:10]** For he was not aware that there is (a Sonship) wiser and more powerful, and better than Himself.

**[11:11]** Therefore imagining Himself to be Lord, and Governor, and a wise Master Builder, He turns Himself to (the work of) the creation of every object in the cosmical system.

**[11:12]** And first, he deemed it proper not to be alone, but made unto Himself, and generated from adjacent (entities), a Son far superior to Himself, and wiser.

**[11:13]** For all these things had the non-existent Deity previously determined upon, when He cast down the (conglomeration of) all germs.

**[11:14]** Beholding, therefore, the Son, He was seized with astonishment, and loved (Him), and was struck with amazement.

**[11:15]** For some beauty of this description appeared to the Great Archon to belong to the Son, and the Archon caused Him to sit on his right (hand).

**[11:16]** This is, according to these (heretics), what is denominated the Ogdoad, where the Great Archon has his throne.

**[11:17]** The entire celestial creation, then, that is, the aether, He Himself, the Great Wise Demiurge formed.

**[11:18]** The Son, however, begotten of this (Archon), operates in Him, and offered Him suggestions, being endued with far greater wisdom than the Demiurge Himself.

**[12:1]** Basilides Adopts the "Entelecheia" Of Aristotle.

**[12:2]** This, then, constitutes the entelecheiaof the natural organic body, according to Aristotle, (viz.

**[12:3]** ,) a soul operating in the body, without which the body is able to accomplish nothing; (I mean nothing) that is greater, and more illustrious, and more powerful, and more wise than the body.

**[12:4]** The account, therefore, which Aristotle has previously rendered concerning the soul and the body, Basilides elucidates as applied to the Great Archon and his Son.

**[12:5]** For the Archon has generated, according to Basilides, a son; and the soul as an operation and completion, Aristotle asserts to be an entelecheia of a natural organic body.

**[12:6]** As, therefore, the entelecheia controls the body, so the Son, according to Basilides, controls the God that is more ineffable than ineffable (entities).

**[12:7]** All things, therefore, have been provided for, and managed by the majesty of the Great Archon; (I mean) whatever objects exist in the aethereal region of space as far as the moon, for from that quarter onwards air is separated from aether.

**[12:8]** When all objects in the aethereal regions, then, were arranged, again from (the conglomeration of) all germs another Archon ascended, greater, of course, than all subjacent (entities), with the exception, however, of the Sonship that had been left behind, but far inferior to the First Archon.

**[12:9]** And this (second Archon) is called by them Rhetus.

**[12:10]** And this Topos is styled Hebdomad, and this (Archon) is the manager and fabricator of all subjacent (entities).

**[12:11]** And He has likewise made unto Himself out (of the conglomeration of) all germs, a son who is more prudent and wise than Himself, similarly to what has been stated to have taken place in the case of the First Archon.

**[12:12]** That which exists in this quarter (of the universe) constitutes, he says, the actual conglomeration and collection of all seeds; and the things which are generated are produced according to nature, as has been declared already by Him who calculates on things future, when they ought (to be), and what sort they ought (to be), and how they ought (to be).

**[12:13]** And of these no one is Chief, or Guardian, or Creator.

**[12:14]** For (a) sufficient (cause of existence) for them is that calculation which the Non-Existent One formed when He exercised the function of creation.

**[13:1]** Further Explanation of the "Sonship".

**[13:2]** When, therefore, according to these (heretics), the entire world and super-mundane entities were finished, and (when) nothing exists labouring under deficiency, there still remains in the (conglomeration of) all germs the third Sonship, which had been left behind in the Seed to confer benefits and receive them.

**[13:3]** And it must needs be that the Sonship which had been left behind ought likewise to be revealed and reinstated above.

**[13:4]** And His place should be above the Conterminous Spirit, near the refined and imitative Sonship and the Non-Existent One.

**[13:5]** But this would be in accordance with what has been written, he says: "And the creation itself groaneth together, and travaileth in pain together, waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God".

**[13:6]** Now, we who are spiritual are sons, he says, who have been left here to arrange, and mould, and rectify, and complete the souls which, according to nature, are so constituted as to continue in this quarter of the universe.

**[13:7]** "Sin, then, reigned from Adam unto Moses," as it has been written.

**[13:8]** For the Great Archon exercised dominion and possesses an empire with limits extending as far as the firmament.

**[13:9]** And He imagines Himself alone to be God, and that there exists nothing above Him, for (the reason that) all things have been guarded by unrevealed Siope.

**[13:10]** This, he says, is the mystery which has not been made known to former generations; but in those days the Great Archon, the Ogdoad, was King and Lord, as it seemed, of the universe.

**[13:11]** But (in reality) the Hebdomad was king and lord of this quarter of the universe, and the Ogdoad is Arrhetus, whereas the Hebdomad is Rhetus.

**[13:12]** This, he says, is the Archon of the Hebdomad, who has spoken to Moses, and says: "I am the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and I have not manifested unto them the name of God" (for so they wish that it had been written)—that is, the God, Arrhetus, Archon of the Ogdoad.

**[13:13]** All the prophets, therefore, who were before the Saviour uttered their predictions, he says, from this source (of inspiration).

**[13:14]** Since, therefore, it was requisite, he says, that we should be revealed as the children of God, in expectation of whose manifestation, he says, the creation habitually groans and travails in pain, the Gospel came into the world, and passed through every Principality, and Power, and Dominion, and every Name that is named.

**[13:15]** And (the Gospel) came in reality, though nothing descended from above; nor did the blessed Sonship retire from that Inconceivable, and Blessed, (and) Non-Existent God.

**[13:16]** Nay, (far from it;) for as Indian naphtha, when lighted merely from a considerably long distance, nevertheless attracts fire (towards it), so from below, from the formlessness of the conglomeration (of all germs), the powers pass upwards as far as the Sonship.

**[13:17]** For, according to the illustration of the Indian naphtha, the Son of the Great Archon of the Ogdoad, as if he were some (sort of) naphtha, apprehends and seizes conceptions from the Blessed Sonship, whose place of habitation is situated after that of the Conterminous (Spirit).

**[13:18]** For the power of the Sonship which is in the midst of the Holy Spirit, (that is,) in, the midst of the (Conterminous) Spirit, shares the flowing and rushing thoughts of the Sonship with the Son of the Great Archon.

**[14:1]** Whence Came the Gospel; The Number of Heavens According to Basilides; Explanation of Christ's Miraculous Conception.

**[14:2]** The Gospel then came, says (Basilides), first from the Sonship through the Son, that was seated beside the Archon, to the Archon, and the Archon learned that He was not God of the universe, but was begotten.

**[14:3]** But (ascertaining that) He has above Himself the deposited treasure of that Ineffable and Unnameable (and) Non-existent One, and of the Sonship, He was both converted and filled with terror, when He was brought to understand in what ignorance He was (involved).

**[14:4]** This, he says, is what has been declared: "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom".

**[14:5]** For, being orally instructed by Christ, who was seated near, he began to acquire wisdom, (inasmuch as he thereby) learns who is the Non-Existent One, what the Sonship (is), what the Holy Spirit (is), what the apparatus of the universe (is), and what is likely to be the consummation of things.

**[14:6]** This is the wisdom spoken in a mystery, concerning which, says (Basilides), Scripture uses the following expressions: "Not in words taught of human wisdom, but in (those) taught of the Spirit".

**[14:7]** The Archon, then, being orally instructed, and taught, and being (thereby) filled with fear, proceeded to make confession concerning the sin which He had committed in magnifying Himself.

**[14:8]** This, he says, is what is declared: "I have recognised my sin, and I know my transgression, (and) about this I shall confess for ever".

**[14:9]** When, then, the Great Archon had been orally instructed, and every creature of the Ogdoad had been orally instructed and taught, and (after) the mystery became known to the celestial (powers), it was also necessary that afterwards the Gospel should come to the Hebdomad, in order likewise that the Archon of the Hebdomad might be similarly instructed and indoctrinated into the Gospel.

**[14:10]** The Son of the Great Archon (therefore) kindled in the Son of the Archon of the Hebdomad the light which Himself possessed and had kindled from above from the Sonship.

**[14:11]** And the Son of the Archon of the Hebdomad had radiance imparted to Him, and He proclaimed the Gospel to the Archon of the Hebdomad.

**[14:12]** And in like manner, according to the previous account, He Himself was both terrified and induced to make confession.

**[14:13]** When, therefore, all (beings) in the Hebdomad had been likewise enlightened, and had the Gospel announced to them (for in these regions of the universe there exist, according to these heretics, creatures infinite (in number), viz.

**[14:14]** , Principalities and Powers and Rulers, in regard of which there is extant among the (Basilidians) a very prolix and verbose treatise, where they allege that there are three hundred and sixty-five heavens, and that the great Archon of these is Abrasax, from the fact that his name comprises the computed number , so that, of course, the calculation of the title includes all (existing) things, and that for these reasons the year consists of so many days);—but when, he says, these (two events, viz.

**[14:15]** , the illumination of the Hebdomad and the manifestation of the Gospel) had thus taken place, it was necessary, likewise, that afterwards the Formlessness existent in our quarter of creation should have radiance imparted to it, and that the mystery should be revealed to the Sonship, which had been left behind in Formlessness, just like an abortion.

**[14:16]** Now this (mystery) was not made known to previous generations, as he says, it has been written, "By revelation was made known unto me the mystery;" and, "I have heard inexpressible words which it is not possible for man to declare".

**[14:17]** The light, (therefore,) which came down from the Ogdoad above to the Son of the Hebdomad, descended from the Hebdomad upon Jesus the son of Mary, and he had radiance imparted to him by being illuminated with the light that shone upon him.

**[14:18]** This, he says, is that which has been declared: "The Holy Spirit will come upon thee," (meaning) that which proceeded from the Sonship through the conterminous spirit upon the Ogdoad and Hebdomad, as far as Mary; "and the power of the Highest will overshadow thee," (meaning) the power of the anointing, (which streamed) from the (celestial) height above (through) the Demiurge, as far as the creation, which is (as far as) the Son.

**[14:19]** And as far as that (Son) he says the world consisted thus.

**[14:20]** And as far as this, the entire Sonship, which is left behind for benefiting the souls in Formlessness, and for being the recipient in turn of benefits,—(this Sonship, I say,) when it is transformed, followed Jesus, and hastened upwards, and came forth purified.

**[14:21]** And it becomes most refined, so that it could, as the first (Sonship), hasten upwards through its own instrumentality.

**[14:22]** For it possesses all the power that, according to nature, is firmly connected with the light which from above shone down (upon earth).

**[15:1]** God's Dealings with the Creature; Basilides' Notion of  the Inner Man,  the Gospel; His Interpretation of the Life and Sufferings of Our Lord.

**[15:2]** When, therefore, he says, the entire Sonship shall have come, and shall be above the conterminous spirit, then the creature will become the object of mercy.

**[15:3]** For (the creature) groans until now, and is tormented, and waits for the manifestation of the sons of God, in order that all who are men of the Sonship may ascend from thence.

**[15:4]** When this takes place, God, he says, will bring upon the whole world enormous ignorance, that all things may continue according to nature, and that nothing may inordinately desire anything of the things that are contrary to nature.

**[15:5]** But (far from it); for all the souls of this quarter of creation, as many as possess the nature of remaining immortal in this (region) only, continue (in it), aware of nothing superior or better (than their present state).

**[15:6]** And there will not prevail any rumour or knowledge in regions below, concerning beings whose dwelling is placed above, lest subjacent souls should be wrung with torture from longing after impossibilities.

**[15:7]** (It would be) just as if a fish were to crave to feed on the mountains along with sheep.

**[15:8]** (For) a wish of this description would, he says, be their destruction.

**[15:9]** All things, therefore, that abide in (this) quarter are incorruptible, but corruptible if they are disposed to wander and cross over from the things that are according to nature.

**[15:10]** In this way the Archon of the Hebdomad will know nothing of superjacent entities.

**[15:11]** For enormous ignorance will lay hold on this one likewise, in order that sorrow, and grief, and groaning may depart from him; for he will not desire aught of impossible things, nor will he be visited with anguish.

**[15:12]** In like manner, however, the same ignorance will lay hold also on the Great Archon of the Ogdoad, and similarly on all the creatures that are subject unto him, in order that in no respect anything may desire aught of those things that are contrary to nature, and may not (thus) be overwhelmed with sorrow.

**[15:13]** And so there will be the restitution of all things which, in conformity with nature, have from the beginning a foundation in the seed of the universe, but will be restored at (their own) proper periods.

**[15:14]** And that each thing, says (Basilides), has its own particular times, the Saviour is a sufficient (witness) when He observes, "Mine hour is not yet come".

**[15:15]** And the Magi (afford similar testimony) when they gaze wistfully upon the (Saviour's) star.

**[15:16]** For (Jesus) Himself was, he says, mentally preconceived at the time of the generation of the stars, and of the complete return to their starting-point of the seasons in the vast conglomeration (of all germs).

**[15:17]** This is, according to these (Basilidians), he who has been conceived as the inner spiritual man in what is natural (now this is the Sonship which left there the soul, not (that it might be) mortal, but that it might abide here according to nature, just as the first Sonship left above in its proper locality the Holy Spirit, (that is, the spirit) which is conterminous),—(this, I say, is he who has been conceived as the inner spiritual man, and) has then been arrayed in his own peculiar soul.

**[15:18]** In order, however, that we may not omit any of the doctrines of this (Basilides), I shall likewise explain whatever statements they put forward respecting a gospel.

**[15:19]** For gospel with them, as has been elucidated, is of super-mundane entities the knowledge which the Great Archon did not understand.

**[15:20]** As, then, it was manifested unto him that there are likewise the Holy Spirit—that is, the conterminous (spirit)—and the Sonship, and the Non-Existent God, the cause of all these, he rejoiced at the communications made to him, and was filled with exultation.

**[15:21]** According to them, this constitutes the gospel.

**[15:22]** Jesus, however, was born, according to these (heretics), as we have already declared.

**[15:23]** And when the generation which has been previously explained took place, all the events in our Lord's life occurred, according to them, in the same manner as they have been described in the Gospels.

**[15:24]** And these things happened, he says, in order that Jesus might become the first-fruits of a distinction of the different orders (of created objects) that had been confused together.

**[15:25]** For when the world had been divided into an Ogdoad, which is the head of the entire world,—now the great Archon is head of the entire world,—and into a Hebdomad,—which is the head of the Hebdomad, the Demiurge of subjacent entities,—and into this order of creatures (that prevails) amongst us, where exists Formlessness, it was requisite that the various orders of created objects that had been confounded together should be distinguished by a separating process performed by Jesus.

**[15:26]** (Now this separation) that which was his corporeal part suffered, and this was (the part) of Formlessness and reverted into Formlessness.

**[15:27]** And that was resuscitated which was his psychical part, and this was (part) of the Hebdomad, and reverted into the Hebdomad.

**[15:28]** And he revived that (element in his nature) which was the peculiar property of the elevated region where dwells the Great Archon, and (that element) remained beside the Great Archon.

**[15:29]** And he carried upwards as far as (that which is) above that which was (the peculiar property) of the conterminous spirit, and he remained in the conterminous spirit.

**[15:30]** And through him there was purified the third Sonship, which had been left for conferring benefits, and receiving them.

**[15:31]** And (through Jesus) it ascended towards the blessed Sonship, and passed through all these.

**[15:32]** For the entire purpose of these was the blending together of, as it were, the conglomeration of all germs, and the distinction of the various orders of created objects, and the restoration into their proper component parts of things that had been blended together.

**[15:33]** Jesus, therefore, became the first-fruits of the distinction of the various orders of created objects, and his Passion took place for not any other reason than the distinction which was thereby brought about in the various orders of created objects that had been confounded together.

**[15:34]** For in this manner (Basilides) says that the entire Sonship, which had been left in Formlessness for the purpose of conferring benefits and receiving them, was divided into its component elements, according to the manner in which also the distinction of natures had taken place in Jesus.

**[15:35]** These, then, are the legends which likewise Basilides details after his sojourn in Egypt; and being instructed by the (sages of this country) in so great a system of wisdom, (the heretic) produced fruits of this description.

**[16:1]** The System of Saturnilus.

**[16:2]** But one Saturnilus, who flourished about the same period with Basilides, but spent his time in Antioch, (a city) of Syria, propounded opinions akin to whatever (tenets) Menander (advanced).

**[16:3]** He asserts that there is one Father, unknown to all—He who had made angels, archangels, principalities, (and) powers; and that by certain angels, seven (in number), the world was made, and all things that are in it.

**[16:4]** And (Saturnilus affirms) that man was a work of angels.

**[16:5]** There had appeared above from (the Being of) absolute sway, a brilliant image; and when (the angels) were not able to detain this, on account of its immediately, he says, returning with rapidity upwards, they exhorted one another, saying, "Let us make man in our likeness and image".

**[16:6]** And when the figure was formed, and was not, he says, able, owing to the impotence of the angels, to lift up itself, but continued writhing as a worm, the Power above, compassionating him on account of his having been born in its own image, sent forth a scintillation of life, which raised man up, and caused him to have vitality.

**[16:7]** (Saturnilus) asserts that this scintillation of life rapidly returns after death to those things that are of the same order of existence; and that the rest, from which they have been generated, are resolved into those.

**[16:8]** And the Saviour he supposed to be unbegotten and incorporeal, and devoid of figure.

**[16:9]** (Saturnilus,) however, (maintained that Jesus) was manifested as man in appearance only.

**[16:10]** And he says that the God of the Jews is one of the angels, and, on account of the Father's wishing to deprive of sovereignty all the Archons, that Christ came for the overthrow of the God of the Jews, and for the salvation of those that believe upon Him; and that these have in them the scintillation of life.

**[16:11]** For he asserted that two kinds of men had been formed by the angels,—one wicked, but the other good.

**[16:12]** And, since demons from time to time assisted wicked (men, Saturnilus affirms) that the Saviour came for the overthrow of worthless men and demons, but for the salvation of good men.

**[16:13]** And he affirms that marriage and procreation are from Satan.

**[16:14]** The majority, however, of those who belong to this (heretic's school) abstain from animal food likewise, (and) by this affectation of asceticism (make many their dupes).

**[16:15]** And (they maintain) that the prophecies have been uttered, partly by the world-making angels, and partly by Satan, who is also the very angel whom they suppose to act in antagonism to the cosmical (angels), and especially to the God of the Jews.

**[16:16]** These, then, are in truth the tenets of Saturnilus.

**[17:1]** Marcion; His Dualism; Derives His System from Empedocles; Sketch of the Doctrine of Empedocles.

**[17:2]** But Marcion, a native of Pontus, far more frantic than these (heretics), omitting the majority of the tenets of the greater number (of speculators), (and) advancing into a doctrine still more unabashed, supposed (the existence of) two originating causes of the universe, alleging one of them to be a certain good (principle), but the other an evil one.

**[17:3]** And himself imagining that he was introducing some novel (opinion), founded a school full of folly, and attended by men of a sensual mode of life, inasmuch as he himself was one of lustful propensities.

**[17:4]** This (heretic) having thought that the multitude would forget that he did not happen to be a disciple of Christ, but of Empedocles, who was far anterior to himself, framed and formed the same opinions,—namely, that there are two causes of the universe, discord and friendship.

**[17:5]** For what does Empedocles say respecting the plan of the world? Even though we have previously spoken (on this subject), yet even now also, for the purpose, at all events, of comparing the heresy of this plagiarist (with its source), we shall not be silent.

**[17:6]** This (philosopher) affirms that all the elements out of which the world consists and derives its being, are six: two of them material, (viz.

**[17:7]** ,) earth and water; and two of them instruments by which material objects are arranged and altered, (viz.

**[17:8]** ,) fire and air; and two of them, by means of the instruments, operating upon matter and fashioning it, viz.

**[17:9]** , discord and friendship.

**[17:10]** (Empedocles) expresses himself somehow thus:—  "The four roots of all things hear thou first:  Brilliant Jove, and life-giving Juno and Aidoneus,  And Nestis, who with tears bedews the mortal font".

**[17:11]** Jupiter is fire, and life-giving Juno earth, which produces fruits for the support of existence; and Aidoneus air, because although through him we behold all things, yet himself alone we do not see.

**[17:12]** But Nestis is water, for this is a sole vehicle of (food), and thus becomes a cause of sustenance to all those that are being nourished; (but) this of itself is not able to afford nutriment to those that are being nourished.

**[17:13]** For if it did possess the power of affording nutriment, animal life, he says, could never be destroyed by famine, inasmuch as water is always superabundant in the world.

**[17:14]** For this reason he denominates Nestis water, because, (though indirectly) being a cause of nutriment, it is not (of itself) competent to afford nutriment to those things that are being nourished.

**[17:15]** These, therefore—to delineate them as by way of outline—are the principles that comprise (Empedocles') entire theory of the world: (viz.

**[17:16]** ,) water and earth, out of which (proceed) generated entities; fire and spirit, (which are) instruments and efficient (causes), but discord and friendship, which are (principles) artistically fabricating (the universe).

**[17:17]** And friendship is a certain peace, and unanimity, and love, whose entire effort is, that there should be one finished and complete world.

**[17:18]** Discord, however, invariably separates that one (world), and subdivides it, or makes many things out of one.

**[17:19]** Therefore discord is of the entire creation a cause which he styles "oulomenon," that is, destructive.

**[17:20]** For it is the concern of this (discord), that throughout every age the creation itself should continue to preserve its existing condition.

**[17:21]** And ruinous discord has been (thus) a fabricator and an efficient cause of the production of all generated entities; whereas friendship (is the cause) of the eduction, and alteration, and restoration of existing things into one system.

**[17:22]** And in regard of these (causes), Empedocles asserts that they are two immortal and unbegotten principles, and such as have not as yet received an originating cause of existence.

**[17:23]** (Empedocles) somewhere or other (expresses himself) in the following manner:—  "For if both once it was, and will be; never, I think,  Will be the age eternal void of both of these".

**[17:24]** (But) what are these (two)? Discord and Friendship; for they did not begin to come into being, but pre-existed and always will exist, because, from the fact of their being unbegotten, they are not able to undergo corruption.

**[17:25]** But fire, (and water,) and earth, and air, are (entities) that perish and revive.

**[17:26]** For when these generated (bodies), by reason of Discord, cease to exist, Friendship, laying hold on them, brings them forward, and attaches and associates them herself with the universe.

**[17:27]** (And this takes place) in order that the Universe may continue one, being always ordered by Friendship in a manner one and the same, and with (uninterrupted) uniformity.

**[17:28]** When, however, Friendship makes unity out of plurality, and associates with unity separated entities, Discord, again, forcibly severs them from unity, and makes them many, that is, fire, water, earth, air, (as well as) the animals and plants produced from these, and whatever portions of the world we observe.

**[17:29]** And in regard of the form of the world, what sort it is, (as) arranged by Friendship, (Empedocles) expresses himself in the following terms:—  "For not from back two arms arise,  Not feet, not nimble knees, not genital groin,  But a globe it was, and equal to itself it is".

**[17:30]** An operation of this description Friendship maintains, and makes (one) most beautiful form of the world out of plurality.

**[17:31]** Discord, however, the cause of the arrangement of each of the parts (of the universe), forcibly severs and makes many things out of that one (form).

**[17:32]** And this is what Empedocles affirms respecting his own generation:—  "Of these I also am from God a wandering exile".

**[17:33]** That is, (Empedocles) denominates as God the unity and unification of that (one form) in which (the world) existed antecedent to the separation and production (introduced) by Discord among the majority of those things (that subsisted) in accordance with the disposition (effected) by Discord.

**[17:34]** For Empedocles affirms Discord to be a furious, and perturbed, and unstable Demiurge, (thus) denominating Discord the creator of the world.

**[17:35]** For this constitutes the condemnation and necessity of souls which Discord forcibly severs from unity, and (which it) fashions and operates upon, (according to Empedocles,) who expresses himself after some such mode as, the following:—  "Who perjury piles on sin,  While demons gain a life prolonged;"  meaning by demons long-lived souls, because they are immortal, and live for lengthened ages:—  "For thrice ten thousand years banished from bliss;"  denominating as blissful, those that have been collected by Friendship from the majority of entities into the process of unification (arising out) of the intelligible world.

**[17:36]** He asserts that those are exiles, and that  "In lapse of time all sorts of mortal men are born,  Changing the irksome ways of life".

**[17:37]** He asserts the irksome ways to be the alterations and transfigurations of souls into (successive) bodies.

**[17:38]** This is what he says:—  "Changing the irksome ways of life".

**[17:39]** For souls "change," body after body being altered, and punished by Discord, and not permitted to continue in the one (frame), but that the souls are involved in all descriptions of punishment by Discord being changed from body to body.

**[17:40]** He says:—  "aethereal force to ocean drives the souls,  And ocean spurts them forth on earth's expanse,  And earth on beams of blazing sun, who flings  (The souls) on aether's depths, and each from each  (A spirit) takes, and all with hatred burn".

**[17:41]** This is the punishment which the Demiurge inflicts, just as some brazier moulding (a piece of) iron, and dipping it successively from fire into water.

**[17:42]** For fire is the aether whence the Demiurge transfers the souls into the sea; and land is the earth: whence he uses the words, from water into earth, and from earth into air.

**[17:43]** This is what (Empedocles) says:—  "And earth on beams  Of blazing sun, who flings (the souls)  On aether's depths, and each from each  A (spirit) takes, and all with hatred burn".

**[17:44]** The souls, then, thus detested, and tormented, and punished in this world, are, according to Empedocles, collected by Friendship as being a certain good (power), and (one) that pities the groaning of these, and the disorderly and wicked device of furious Discord.

**[17:45]** And (likewise Friendship is) eager, and toils to lead forth little by little the souls from the world, and to domesticate them with unity, in order that all things, being conducted by herself, may attain unto unification.

**[17:46]** Therefore on account of such an arrangement on the part of destructive Discord of this divided world, Empedocles admonishes his disciples to abstain from all sorts of animal food.

**[17:47]** For he asserts that the bodies of animals are such as feed on the habitations of punished souls.

**[17:48]** And he teaches those who are hearers of such doctrines (as his), to refrain from intercourse with women.

**[17:49]** (And he issues this precept) in order that (his disciples) may not co-operate with and assist those works which Discord fabricates, always dissolving and forcibly severing the work of Friendship.

**[17:50]** Empedocles asserts that this is the greatest law of the management of the universe, expressing himself somehow thus:—  "There's something swayed by Fate, the ancient,  Endless law of gods, and sealed by potent oaths".

**[17:51]** He thus calls Fate the alteration from unity into plurality, according to Discord, and from plurality into unity, according to Friendship.

**[17:52]** And, as I stated, (Empedocles asserts) that there are four perishable gods, (viz.

**[17:53]** ,) fire, water, earth, (and) air.

**[17:54]** (He maintains,) however, that there are two (gods) which are immortal, unbegotten, (and) continually hostile one to the other, (namely) Discord and Friendship.

**[17:55]** And (he asserts) that Discord always is guilty of injustice and covetousness, and forcible abduction of the things of Friendship, and of appropriation of them to itself.

**[17:56]** (He alleges,) however, that Friendship, inasmuch as it is always and invariably a certain good (power), and intent on union, recalls and brings towards (itself), and reduces to unity, the parts of the universe that have been forcibly severed, and tormented, and punished in the creation by the Demiurge.

**[17:57]** Some such system of philosophy as the foregoing is advanced for us by Empedocles concerning the generation of the world, and its destruction, and its constitution, as one consisting of what is good and bad.

**[17:58]** And he says that there is likewise a certain third power which is cognised by intellect, and that this can be understood from these, (viz.

**[17:59]** , Discord and Friendship,) expressing himself somehow thus:—  "For if, 'neath hearts of oak, these truths you fix,  And view them kindly in meditations pure,  Each one of these, in lapse of time, will haunt you,  And many others, sprung of these, descend.

**[17:60]** For into every habit these will grow, as Nature prompts;  But if for other things you sigh, which, countless, linger  Undisguised 'mid men, and blunt the edge of care,  As years roll on they'll leave you fleetly,  Since they yearn to reach their own beloved race;  For know that all possess perception and a share of mind".

**[18:1]** Source of Marcionism; Empedocles Reasserted as the Suggester of the Heresy.

**[18:2]** When, therefore, Marcion or some one of his hounds barks against the Demiurge, and adduces reasons from a comparison of what is good and bad, we ought to say to them, that neither Paul the apostle nor Mark, he of the maimed finger, announced such (tenets).

**[18:3]** For none of these (doctrines) has been written in the Gospel according to Mark.

**[18:4]** But (the real author of the system) is Empedocles, son of Meto, a native of Agrigentum.

**[18:5]** And (Marcion) despoiled this (philosopher), and imagined that up to the present would pass undetected his transference, under the same expressions, of the arrangement of his entire heresy from Sicily into the evangelical narratives.

**[18:6]** For bear with me, O Marcion: as you have instituted a comparison of what is good and evil, I also to-day will institute a comparison following up your own tenets, as you suppose them to be.

**[18:7]** You affirm that the Demiurge of the world is evil—why not hide your countenance in shame, (as thus) teaching to the Church the doctrines of Empedocles? You say that there is a good Deity who destroys the works of the Demiurge: then do not you plainly preach to your pupils, as the good Deity, the Friendship of Empedocles.

**[18:8]** You forbid marriage, the procreation of children, (and) the abstaining from meats which God has created for participation by the faithful, and those that know the truth.

**[18:9]** (Thinkest thou, then,) that thou canst escape detection, (while thus) enjoining the purificatory rites of Empedocles? For in point of fact you follow in every respect this (philosopher of paganism), while you instruct your own disciples to refuse meats, in order not to eat any body (that might be) a remnant of a soul which has been punished by the Demiurge.

**[18:10]** You dissolve marriages that have been cemented by the Deity.

**[18:11]** And here again you conform to the tenets of Empedocles, in order that for you the work of Friendship may be perpetuated as one (and) indivisible.

**[18:12]** For, according to Empedocles, matrimony separates unity, and makes (out of it) plurality, as we have proved.

**[19:1]** The Heresy of Prepon; Follows Empedocles; Marcion Rejects the Generation of the Saviour.

**[19:2]** The principal heresy of Marcion, and (the one of his) which is most free from admixture (with other heresies), is that which has its system formed out of the theory concerning the good and bad (God).

**[19:3]** Now this, it has been manifested by us, belongs to Empedocles.

**[19:4]** But since at present, in our times, a certain follower of Marcion, (namely) Prepon, an Assyrian, has endeavoured to introduce something more novel, and has given an account of his heresy in a work inscribed to Bardesanes, an Armenian, neither of this will I be silent.

**[19:5]** In alleging that what is just constitutes a third principle, and that it is placed intermediate between what is good and bad, Prepon of course is not able to avoid (the imputation of inculcating) the opinion of Empedocles.

**[19:6]** For Empedocles asserts that the world is managed by wicked Discord, and that the other (world) which (is managed) by Friendship, is cognisable by intellect.

**[19:7]** And (he asserts) that these are the two different principles of good and evil, and that intermediate between these diverse principles is impartial reason, in accordance with which are united the things that have been separated by Discord, (and which,) in accordance with the influence of Friendship, are accommodated to unity.

**[19:8]** The impartial reason itself, that which is an auxiliary to Friendship, Empedocles denominates "Musa".

**[19:9]** And he himself likewise entreats her to assist him, and expresses himself somehow thus:—  "For if on fleeting mortals, deathless Muse,  Thy care it be that thoughts our mind engross,  Calliope, again befriend my present prayer,  As I disclose a pure account of happy gods".

**[19:10]** Marcion, adopting these sentiments, rejected altogether the generation of our Saviour.

**[19:11]** He considered it to be absurd that under the (category of a) creature fashioned by destructive Discord should have been the Logos that was an auxiliary to Friendship—that is, the Good Deity.

**[19:12]** (His doctrine,) however, was that, independent of birth, (the Logos) Himself descended from above in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, and that, as being intermediate between the good and bad Deity, He proceeded to give instruction in the synagogues.

**[19:13]** For if He is a Mediator, He has been, he says, liberated from the entire nature of the Evil Deity.

**[19:14]** Now, as he affirms, the Demiurge is evil, and his works.

**[19:15]** For this reason, he affirms, Jesus came down unbegotten, in order that He might be liberated from all (admixture of) evil.

**[19:16]** And He has, he says, been liberated from the nature of the Good One likewise, in order that He may be a Mediator, as Paul states, and as Himself acknowledges: "Why call ye me good? there is one good".

**[19:17]** These, then, are the opinions of Marcion, by means of which he made many his dupes, employing the conclusions of Empedocles.

**[19:18]** And he transferred the philosophy invented by that (ancient speculator) into his own system of thought, and (out of Empedocles) constructed his (own) impious heresy.

**[19:19]** But I consider that this has been sufficiently refuted by us, and that I have not omitted any opinion of those who purloin their opinions from the Greeks, and act despitefully towards the disciples of Christ, as if they had become teachers to them of these (tenets).

**[19:20]** But since it seems that we have sufficiently explained the doctrines of this (heretic), let us see what Carpocrates says.

**[20:1]** The Heresy of Carpocrates; Wicked Doctrines Concerning Jesus Christ; Practise Magical Arts; Adopt a Metempsychosis.

**[20:2]** Carpocrates affirms that the world and the things in it were made by angels, far inferior to the unbegotten Father; and that Jesus was generated of Joseph, and that, having been born similar to (other) men, He was more just than the rest (of the human race).

**[20:3]** And (Carpocrates asserts) that the soul (of Jesus), inasmuch as it was made vigorous and undefiled, remembered the things seen by it in its converse with the unbegotten God.

**[20:4]** And (Carpocrates maintains) that on this account there was sent down upon (Jesus) by that (God) a power, in order that through it He might be enabled to escape the world-making (angels).

**[20:5]** And (he says) that this power, having passed through all, and having obtained liberty in all, again ascended to God (Himself).

**[20:6]** And (he alleges) that in the same condition with (the soul of Jesus are all the souls) that embrace similar objects of desire with the (power just alluded to).

**[20:7]** And they assert that the soul of Jesus, (though,) according to law, it was disciplined in Jewish customs, (in reality) despised them.

**[20:8]** And (he says) that on this account (Jesus) received powers whereby He rendered null and void the passions incidental to men for their punishment.

**[20:9]** And (he argues), therefore, that the (soul), which, similarly with that soul of Christ, is able to despise the world-making Archons, receives in like manner power for the performance of similar acts.

**[20:10]** Wherefore, also, (according to Carpocrates, there are persons who) have attained unto such a degree of pride as to affirm some of themselves to be equal to Jesus Himself, whereas others among them to be even still more powerful.

**[20:11]** But (they also contend) that some enjoy an excellence above the disciples of that (Redeemer), for instance Peter and Paul, and the rest of the Apostles, and that these are in no respect inferior to Jesus.

**[20:12]** And (Carpocrates asserts) that the souls of these have originated from that supernal power, and that consequently they, as equally despising the world-making (angels), have been deemed worthy of the same power, and (of the privilege) to ascend to the same (place).

**[20:13]** If, however, any one would despise earthly concerns more than did that (Saviour, Carpocrates says) that such a one would be able to become superior to (Jesus.

**[20:14]** The followers of this heretic) practise their magical arts and incantations, and spells and voluptuous feasts.

**[20:15]** And (they are in the habit of invoking the aid of) subordinate demons and dream-senders, and (of resorting to) the rest of the tricks (of sorcery), alleging that they possess power for now acquiring sway over the Archons and makers of this world, nay, even over all the works that are in it.

**[20:16]** (Now these heretics) have themselves been sent forth by Satan, for the purpose of slandering before the Gentiles the divine name of the Church.

**[20:17]** (And the devil's object is,) that men hearing, now after one fashion and now after another, the doctrines of those (heretics), and thinking that all of us are people of the same stamp, may turn away their ears from the preaching of the truth, or that they also, looking, (without abjuring,) upon all the tenets of those (heretics), may speak hurtfully of us.

**[20:18]** (The followers of Carpocrates) allege that the souls are transferred from body to body, so far as that they may fill up (the measure of) all their sins.

**[20:19]** When, however, not one (of these sins) is left, (the Carpocratians affirm that the soul) is then emancipated, and departs unto that God above of the world-making angels, and that in this way all souls will be saved.

**[20:20]** If, however, some (souls), during the presence of the soul in the body for one life, may by anticipation become involved in the full measure of transgressions, they, (according to these heretics,) no longer undergo metempsychosis.

**[20:21]** (Souls of this sort,) however, on paying off at once all trespasses, will, (the Carpocratians say,) be emancipated from dwelling any more in a body.

**[20:22]** Certain, likewise, of these (heretics) brand their own disciples in the back parts of the lobe of the right ear.

**[20:23]** And they make counterfeit images of Christ, alleging that these were in existence at the time (during which our Lord was on earth, and that they were fashioned) by Pilate.

**[21:1]** The System of Cerinthus Concerning Christ.

**[21:2]** But a certain Cerinthus, himself being disciplined in the teaching of the Egyptians, asserted that the world was not made by the primal Deity, but by some virtue which was an offshoot from that Power which is above all things, and which (yet) is ignorant of the God that is above all.

**[21:3]** And he supposed that Jesus was not generated from a virgin, but that he was born son of Joseph and Mary, just in a manner similar with the rest of men, and that (Jesus) was more just and more wise (than all the human race).

**[21:4]** And (Cerinthus alleges) that, after the baptism (of our Lord), Christ in form of a dove came down upon him, from that absolute sovereignty which is above all things.

**[21:5]** And then, (according to this heretic,) Jesus proceeded to preach the unknown Father, and in attestation (of his mission) to work miracles.

**[21:6]** It was, however, (the opinion of Cerinthus,) that ultimately Christ departed from Jesus, and that Jesus suffered and rose again; whereas that Christ, being spiritual, remained beyond the possibility of suffering.

**[22:1]** Doctrine of the Ebionaeans.

**[22:2]** The Ebionaeans, however, acknowledge that the world was made by Him Who is in reality God, but they propound legends concerning the Christ similarly with Cerinthus and Carpocrates.

**[22:3]** They live conformably to the customs of the Jews, alleging that they are justified according to the law, and saying that Jesus was justified by fulfilling the law.

**[22:4]** And therefore it was, (according to the Ebionaeans,) that (the Saviour) was named (the) Christ of God and Jesus, since not one of the rest (of mankind) had observed completely the law.

**[22:5]** For if even any other had fulfilled the commandments (contained) in the law, he would have been that Christ.

**[22:6]** And the (Ebionaeans allege) that they themselves also, when in like manner they fulfil (the law), are able to become Christs; for they assert that our Lord Himself was a man in a like sense with all (the rest of the human family).

**[23:1]** The Heresy of Theodotus.

**[23:2]** But there was a certain Theodotus, a native of Byzantium, who introduced a novel heresy.

**[23:3]** He announces tenets concerning the originating cause of the universe, which are partly in keeping with the doctrines of the true Church, in so far as he acknowledges that all things were created by God.

**[23:4]** Forcibly appropriating, however, (his notions of) Christ from the school of the Gnostics, and of Cerinthus and Ebion, he alleges that (our Lord) appeared in some such manner as I shall now describe.

**[23:5]** (According to this, Theodotus maintains) that Jesus was a (mere) man, born of a virgin, according to the counsel of the Father, and that after he had lived promiscuously with all men, and had become pre-eminently religious, he subsequently at his baptism in Jordan received Christ, who came from above and descended (upon him) in form of a dove.

**[23:6]** And this was the reason, (according to Theodotus,) why (miraculous) powers did not operate within him prior to the manifestation in him of that Spirit which descended, (and) which proclaims him to be the Christ.

**[23:7]** But (among the followers of Theodotus) some are disposed (to think) that never was this man made God, (even) at the descent of the Spirit; whereas others (maintain that he was made God) after the resurrection from the dead.

**[24:1]** The Melchisedecians; The Nicolaitans.

**[24:2]** While, however, different questions have arisen among them, a certain (heretic), who himself also was styled Theodotus, and who was by trade a banker, attempted to establish (the doctrine), that a certain Melchisedec constitutes the greatest power, and that this one is greater than Christ.

**[24:3]** And they allege that Christ happens to be according to the likeness (of this Melchisedec).

**[24:4]** And they themselves, similarly with those who have been previously spoken of as adherents of Theodotus, assert that Jesus is a (mere) man, and that, in conformity with the same account (already given), Christ descended upon him.

**[24:5]** There are, however, among the Gnostics diversities of opinion; but we have decided that it would not be worth while to enumerate the silly doctrines of these (heretics), inasmuch as they are (too) numerous and devoid of reason, and full of blasphemy.

**[24:6]** Now, even those (of the heretics) who are of a more serious turn in regard of the Divinity, and have derived their systems of speculation from the Greeks, must stand convicted (of these charges).

**[24:7]** But Nicolaus has been a cause of the wide-spread combination of these wicked men.

**[24:8]** He, as one of the seven (that were chosen) for the diaconate, was appointed by the Apostles.

**[24:9]** (But Nicolaus) departed from correct doctrine, and was in the habit of inculcating indifferency of both life and food.

**[24:10]** And when the disciples (of Nicolaus) continued to offer insult to the Holy Spirit, John reproved them in the Apocalypse as fornicators and eaters of things offered unto idols.

**[25:1]** The Heresy of Cerdon.

**[25:2]** But one Cerdon himself also, taking occasion in like manner from these (heretics) and Simon, affirms that the God preached by Moses and the prophets was not Father of Jesus Christ.

**[25:3]** For (he contends) that this (Father) had been known, whereas that the Father of Christ was unknown, and that the former was just, but the latter good.

**[25:4]** And Marcion corroborated the tenet of this (heretic) in the work which he attempted to write, and which he styled Antitheses.

**[25:5]** And he was in the habit, (in this book,) of uttering whatever slanders suggested themselves to his mind against the Creator of the universe.

**[25:6]** In a similar manner likewise (acted) Lucian, the disciple of this (heretic).

**[26:1]** The Doctrines of Apelles; Philumene, His Prophetess.

**[26:2]** But Apelles, sprung from these, thus expresses himself, (saying) that there is a certain good Deity, as also Marcion supposed, and that he who created all things is just.

**[26:3]** Now he, (according to Apelles,) was the Demiurge of generated entities.

**[26:4]** And (this heretic also maintains) that there is a third (Deity), the one who was in the habit of speaking to Moses, and that this (god) was of a fiery nature, and that there was another fourth god, a cause of evils.

**[26:5]** But these he denominates angels.

**[26:6]** He utters, however, slanders against law and prophets, by alleging that the things that have been written are (of) human (origin), and are false.

**[26:7]** And (Apelles) selects from the Gospels or (from the writings of) the Apostle (Paul) whatever pleases himself.

**[26:8]** But he devotes himself to the discourses of a certain Philumene as to the revelations of a prophetess.

**[26:9]** He affirms, however, that Christ descended from the power above; that is, from the good (Deity), and that he is the son of that good (Deity).

**[26:10]** And (he asserts that Jesus) was not born of a virgin, and that when he did appear he was not devoid of flesh.

**[26:11]** (He maintains,) however, that (Christ) formed his body by taking portions of it from the substance of the universe: that is, hot and cold, and moist and dry.

**[26:12]** And (he says that Christ), on receiving in this body cosmical powers, lived for the time he did in (this) world.

**[26:13]** But (he held that Jesus) was subsequently crucified by the Jews, and expired, and that, being raised up after three days, he appeared to his disciples.

**[26:14]** And (the Saviour) showed them, (so Apelles taught,) the prints of the nails and (the wound) in his side, desirous of persuading them that he was in truth no phantom, but was present in the flesh.

**[26:15]** After, says (Apelles), he had shown them his flesh, (the Saviour) restored it to earth, from which substance it was (derived.

**[26:16]** And this he did because) he coveted nothing that belonged to another.

**[26:17]** (Though indeed Jesus) might use for the time being (what belonged to another), he yet in due course rendered to each (of the elements) what peculiarly belonged to them.

**[26:18]** And so it was, that after he had once more loosed the chains of his body, he gave back heat to what is hot, cold to what is cold, moisture to what is moist, (and) dryness to what is dry.

**[26:19]** And in this condition (our Lord) departed to the good Father, leaving the seed of life in the world for those who through his disciples should believe in him.

**[26:20]** It appears to us that these (tenets) have been sufficiently explained.

**[26:21]** Since, however, we have determined to leave unrefuted not one of those opinions that have been advanced by any (of the heretics), let us see what (system) also has been invented by the Docetae.
