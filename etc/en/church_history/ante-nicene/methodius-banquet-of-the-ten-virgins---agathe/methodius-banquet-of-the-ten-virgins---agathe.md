# Methodius: Banquet of the Ten Virgins - Agathe

**[1:1]** Agathe: Chapter I.

**[1:2]** —The Excellence of the Abiding Glory of Virginity; The Soul Made in the Image of the Image of God, that is of His Son; The Devil a Suitor for the Soul.

**[1:3]** With great confidence of being able to persuade, and to carry on this admirable discourse, O Arete, if thou go with me, will I also endeavour, according to my ability, to contribute something to the discussion of the subject before us; something commensurate to my own power, and not to be compared with that which has already been spoken.

**[1:4]** For I should be unable to put forth in philosophizing anything that could compete with those things which have already been so variously and brilliantly worked out.

**[1:5]** For I shall seem to bear away the reproach of silliness, if I make an effort to match myself with my superiors in wisdom.

**[1:6]** If, however, you will bear even with those who speak as they can, I will endeavour to speak, not lacking at least in good will.

**[1:7]** And here let me begin.

**[1:8]** We have all come into this world, O virgins, endowed with singular beauty, which has a relationship and affinity to divine wisdom.

**[1:9]** For the souls of men do then most accurately resemble Him who begat and formed them, when, reflecting the unsullied representation of His likeness, and the features of that countenance, to which God looking formed them to have an immortal and indestructible shape, they remain such.

**[1:10]** For the unbegotten and incorporeal beauty, which neither begins nor is corruptible, but is unchangeable, and grows not old and has need of nothing, He resting in Himself, and in the very light which is in unspeakable and inapproachable places, embracing all things in the circumference of His power, creating and arranging, made the soul after the image of His image.

**[1:11]** Therefore, also, it is reasonable and immortal.

**[1:12]** For being made after the image of the Only-begotten, as I said, it has an unsurpassable beauty, and therefore evil spirits love it, and plot and strive to defile its godlike and lovely image, as the prophet Jeremiah shows, reproaching Jerusalem, "Thou hadst a whore's forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed;" speaking of her who prostituted herself to the powers which came against her to pollute her.

**[1:13]** For her lovers are the devil and his angels, who plan to defile and pollute our reasonable and clear-sighted beauty of mind by intercourse with themselves, and desire to cohabit with every soul which is betrothed to the Lord.

**[2:1]** Chapter II.

**[2:2]** —The Parable of the Ten Virgins.

**[2:3]** If, then, any one will keep this beauty inviolate and unharmed, and such as He who constructed it formed and fashioned it, imitating the eternal and intelligible nature of which man is the representation and likeness, and will become like a glorious and holy image, he will be transferred thence to heaven, the city of the blessed, and will dwell there as in a sanctuary.

**[2:4]** Now our beauty is then best preserved undefiled and perfect when, protected by virginity, it is not darkened by the heat of corruption from without; but, remaining in itself, it is adorned with righteousness, being brought as a bride to the Son of God; as He also Himself suggests, exhorting that the light of chastity should be kindled in their flesh, as in lamps; since the number of the ten virgins s signifies the souls that have believed in Jesus Christ, symbolizing by the ten the only right way to heaven.

**[2:5]** Now five of them were prudent and wise; and five were foolish and unwise, for they had not the forethought to fill their vessels with oil, remaining destitute of righteousness.

**[2:6]** Now by these He signifies those who strive to come to the boundaries of virginity, and who strain every nerve to fulfil this love, acting virtuously and temperately, and who profess and boast that this is their aim; but who, making light of it, and being subdued by the changes of the world, come rather to be sketches of the shadowy image of virtue, than workers who represent the living truth itself.

**[3:1]** Chapter III.

**[3:2]** —The Same Endeavour and Effort After Virginity, with a Different Result.

**[3:3]** Now when it is said that "the kingdom of heaven is likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom," this means that the same way towards the goal had been entered upon, as is shown by the mark X.

**[3:4]** By profession they had equally proposed the same end, and therefore they are called ten, since, as I have said, they chose the same profession; but they did not, for all that, go forth in the same way to meet the bridegroom.

**[3:5]** For some provided abundant future nourishment for their lamps which were fed with oil, but others were careless, thinking only of the present.

**[3:6]** And, therefore, they are divided into two equal numbers of five, inasmuch as the one class preserved the five senses, which most people consider the gates of wisdom, pure and undefiled by sins; but the others, on the contrary, corrupted them by multitudes of sins, defiling themselves with evil.

**[3:7]** For having restrained them, and kept them free from righteousness, they bore a more abundant crop of transgressions, in consequence of which it came to pass that they were forbidden, and shut out from the divine courts.

**[3:8]** For whether, on the one hand, we do right, or, on the other, do wrong through these senses, our habits of good and evil are confirmed.

**[3:9]** And as Thallousa said that there is a chastity of the eyes, and of the ears, and of the tongue, and so on of the other senses; so here she who keeps inviolate the faith of the five pathways of virtue—sight, taste, smell, touch, and hearing—is called by the name of the five virgins, because she has kept the five forms of the sense pure to Christ, as a lamp, causing the light of holiness to shine forth clearly from each of them.

**[3:10]** For the flesh is truly, as it were, our five-lighted lamp, which the soul will bear like a torch, when it stands before Christ the Bridegroom, on the day of the resurrection, showing her faith springing out clear and bright through all the senses, as He Himself taught, saying, "I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I if it be already kindled?" meaning by the earth our bodies, in which He wished the swift-moving and fiery operation of His doctrine to be kindled.

**[3:11]** Now the oil represents wisdom and righteousness; for while the soul rains down unsparingly, and pours forth these things upon the body, the light of virtue is kindled unquenchably, making its good actions to shine before men, so that our Father which is in heaven may be glorified.

**[4:1]** Chapter IV.

**[4:2]** —What the Oil in the Lamps Means.

**[4:3]** Now they offered, in Leviticus, oil of this kind, "pure oil olive, beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually, without the veil…before the Lord".

**[4:4]** But they were commanded to have a feeble light from the evening to the morning.

**[4:5]** For their light seemed to resemble the prophetic word, which gives encouragement to temperance, being nourished by the acts and the faith of the people.

**[4:6]** But the temple (in which the light was kept burning) refers to "the lot of their inheritance," inasmuch as a light can shine in only one house.

**[4:7]** Therefore it was necessary that it should be lighted before day.

**[4:8]** For he says, "they shall burn it until the morning," that is, until the coming of Christ.

**[4:9]** But the Sun of chastity and of righteousness having arisen, there is no need of other light.

**[4:10]** So long, then, as this people treasured up nourishment for the light, supplying oil by their works, the light of continence was not extinguished among them, but was ever shining and giving light in the "lot of their inheritance".

**[4:11]** But when the oil failed, by their turning away from the faith to incontinence, the light was entirely extinguished, so that the virgins have again to kindle their lamps by light transmitted from one to another, bringing the light of incorruption to the world from above.

**[4:12]** Let us then supply now the oil of good works abundantly, and of prudence, being purged from all corruption which would weigh us down; lest, while the Bridegroom tarries, our lamps may also in like manner be extinguished.

**[4:13]** For the delay is the interval which precedes the appearing of Christ.

**[4:14]** Now the slumbering and sleeping of the virgins signifies the departure from life; and the midnight is the kingdom of Antichrist, during which the destroying angel passes over the houses.

**[4:15]** But the cry which was made when it was said, "Behold the bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him," is the voice which shall be heard from heaven, and the trumpet, when the saints, all their bodies being raised, shall be caught up, and shall go on the clouds to meet the Lord.

**[4:16]** For it is to be observed that the word of God says, that after the cry all the virgins arose, that is, that the dead shall be raised after the voice which comes from heaven, as also Paul intimates, that "the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first;" that is the tabernacles, for they died, being put off by their souls.

**[4:17]** "Then we which are alive shall be caught up together with them," meaning our souls.

**[4:18]** For we truly who are alive are the souls which, with the bodies, having put them on again, shall go to meet Him in the clouds, bearing our lamps trimmed, not with anything alien and worldly, but like stars radiating the light of prudence and continence, full of ethereal splendour.

**[5:1]** Chapter V.

**[5:2]** —The Reward of Virginity.

**[5:3]** These, O fair virgins, are the orgies of our mysteries; these the mystic rites of those who are initiated in virginity; these the "undefiled rewards" of the conflict of virginity.

**[5:4]** I am betrothed to the Word, and receive as a reward the eternal crown of immortality and riches from the Father; and I triumph in eternity, crowned with the bright and unfading flowers of wisdom.

**[5:5]** I am one in the choir with Christ dispensing His rewards in heaven, around the unbeginning and never-ending King.

**[5:6]** I have become the torch-bearer of the unapproachable lights, and I join with their company in the new song of the archangels, showing forth the new grace of the Church; for the Word says that the company of virgins always follow the Lord, and have fellowship with Him wherever He is.

**[5:7]** And this is what John signifies in the commemoration of the hundred and forty-four thousand.

**[5:8]** Go then, ye virgin band of the new ages.

**[5:9]** Go, fill your vessels with righteousness, for the hour is coming when ye must rise and meet the bridegroom.

**[5:10]** Go, lightly leaving on one side the fascinations and the pleasures of life, which confuse and bewitch the soul; and thus shall ye attain the promises, "This I swear by Him who has shown me the way of life".

**[5:11]** This crown, woven by the prophets, I have taken from the prophetic meadows, and offer to thee, O Arete.

**[5:12]** Agathe having thus admirably brought her discourse to an end, she said, and having been applauded for what she had uttered, Arete again commanded Procilla to speak.

**[5:13]** And she, rising and passing before the entrance, spoke thus.
