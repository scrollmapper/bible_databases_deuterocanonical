For if the \"order of nature,\" as he himself admits, bears additional testimony to the Son's name by reason of His being begotten, and thus the correspondence of the name is according to the relation of the Begotten to the Begetter, how comes it that he wrests the significance of the word \"Son\" from its natural application, and changes the relation to \"the thing made and its maker\"—a relation which applies not only in the case of the elements of the universe, but might also be asserted of a gnat or an ant—that in so far as each of these is a thing made, the relation of its name to its maker is similarly equivalent? The blasphemous nature of his doctrine is clear, not only from many other passages, but even from those quoted: and as for that \"use of the saints\" which he alleges that he follows in these expressions, it is clear that there is no such use at all."
