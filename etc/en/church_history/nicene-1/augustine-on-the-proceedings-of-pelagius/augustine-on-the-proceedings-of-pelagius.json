It has indeed not been defined when a man may become without sin; it has only been judicially settled, that this result can only be reached by the assisting grace of God; it has not, I say, been defined whether a man, whilst he is in this flesh which lusts against the Spirit, ever has been, or now is, or ever can be, by his present use of reason and free will, either in the full society of man or in monastic solitude, in such a state as to be beyond the necessity of offering up the prayer, not in behalf of others, but for himself personally: \"Forgive us our debts;\" or whether this gift shall be consummated at the time when \"we shall be like Him, when we shall see Him as He is,\"—when it shall be said, not by those that are fighting: \"I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind,\" but by those that are triumphing: \"O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?\" Now, this is perhaps hardly a question which ought to be discussed between catholics and heretics, but only among catholics with a view to a peaceful settlement."
