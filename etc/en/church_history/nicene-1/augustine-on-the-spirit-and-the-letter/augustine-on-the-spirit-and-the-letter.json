In this way the two statements will not be contrary, nor will they be repugnant to each other: even the righteous man may lawfully use a good law, and yet the law be not made for the righteous man; for it is not by the law that he becomes righteous, but by the law of faith, which led him to believe that no other resource was possible to his weakness for fulfilling the precepts which \"the law of works\" commanded, except to be assisted by the grace of God."

And must the other nine commandments, which are rightly observed in their literal form, not be regarded as belonging to the law of works by which none is justified, but to the law of faith whereby the just man lives? Who can possibly entertain so absurd an opinion as to suppose that \"the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones,\" is not said equally of all the ten commandments, but only of the solitary one touching the Sabbath-day? In which class do we place that which is thus spoken of: \"The law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression?\" and again thus: \"Until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law?\" and also that which we have already so often quoted: \"By the law is the knowledge of sin?\" and especially the passage in which the apostle has more clearly expressed the question of which we are treating: \"I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet?\"."

Or did the apostle perhaps deem it probable, because he had previously said that \"with God there is no respect of persons,\" and had afterwards said that \"God is not the God of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles,\"—that even such scanty little works of the law, as are suggested by nature, were not discovered in such as received not the law, except as the result of the remains of the image of God; which He does not disdain when they believe in Him, with whom there is no respect of persons? But whichever of these views is accepted, it is evident that the grace of God was promised to the new testament even by the prophet, and that this grace was definitively announced to take this shape,—God's laws were to be written in men's hearts; and they were to arrive at such a knowledge of God, that they were not each one to teach his neighbour and brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all were to know Him, from the least to the greatest of them."
