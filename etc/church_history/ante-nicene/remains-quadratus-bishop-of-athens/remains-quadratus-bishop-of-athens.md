# Remains: Quadratus, Bishop of Athens

[1:1] Quadratus, Bishop of Athens.

[1:2] a.

[1:3] d.

[1:4] Quadratus is spoken of by Eusebius as a "man of understanding and of Apostolic faith".

[1:5] And he celebrates Aristides as a man of similar character.

[1:6] These were the earliest apologists; both addressed their writings to Hadrian, and they were extant and valued in the churches in the time of Eusebius.

[1:7] From the Apology for the Christian Religion.

[1:8] Our Saviour's works, moreover, were always present:  for they were real, consisting of those who had been healed of their diseases, those who had been raised from the dead; who were not only seen whilst they were being healed and raised up, but were afterwards constantly present.

[1:9] Nor did they remain only during the sojourn of the Saviour on earth, but also a considerable time after His departure; and, indeed, some of them have survived even down to our own times.
