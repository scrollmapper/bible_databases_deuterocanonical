# To Stagirius

[1:1] Letter VI.

[1:2] —To Stagirius.

[1:3] They say that conjurors in theatres contrive some such marvel as this which I am going to describe.

[1:4] Having taken some historical narrative, or some old story as the ground-plot of their sleight of hand, they relate the story to the spectators in action.

[1:5] And it is in this way that they make their representations of the narrative.

[1:6] They put on their dresses and masks, and rig up something to resemble a town on the stage with hangings, and then so associate the bare scene with their life-like imitation of action that they are a marvel to the spectators—both the actors themselves of the incidents of the play, and the hangings, or rather their imaginary city.

[1:7] What do I mean, do you think, by this allegory? Since we must needs show to those who are coming together that which is not a city as though it were one, do you let yourself be persuaded to become for the nonce the founder of our city, by just putting in an appearance there; I will make the desert-place seem to be a city; now it is no great distance for you, and the favour which you will confer is very great; for we wish to show ourselves more splendid to our companions here, which we shall do if, in place of any other ornament, we are adorned with the splendour of your party.
