					},
					{
						"text": "It were indeed meet for us not at all to requirethe aid of the written Word, but to exhibit a life so pure, that the grace of the Spirit should be instead of books to our souls, and that as these are inscribed with ink, even so should our hearts be with the Spirit."
					},
					{
						"text": "But, since we have utterly put away from us this grace, come, let us at any rate embrace the second best course."
					},
					{
						"text": "For that the former was better, God hath made manifest,both by His words, and by His doings."
					},
					{
						"text": "Since unto Noah, and unto Abraham, and unto his offspring, and unto Job, and unto Moses too, He discoursed not by writings, but Himself by Himself, finding their mind pure."
					},
					{
						"text": "But after the whole people of the Hebrews had fallen into the very pit of wickedness, then and thereafter was a written word, and tables, and the admonition which is given by these."
					},
					{
						"text": "And this one may perceive was the case, not of the saints in the Old Testament only, but also of those in the New."
					},
					{
						"text": "For neither to the apostles did God give anything in writing, but instead of written words He promised that He would give them the grace of the Spirit: for \"He,\" saith our Lord, \"shall bring all things to your remembrance\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "And that thou mayest learn that this was far better, hear what He saith by the Prophet: \"I will make a new covenant with you, putting my laws into their mind, and in their heart I will write them,\" and, \"they shall be all taught of God\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "And Paul too, pointing out the same superiority, said, that they had received a law \"not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "But since in process of time they made shipwreck, some with regard to doctrines, others as to life and manners, there was again need that they should be put in remembrance by the written word."
					},
					{
						"text": "Reflect then how great an evil it is for us, who ought to live so purely as not even to need written words, but to yield up our hearts, as books, to the Spirit; now that we have lost that honor, and are come to have need of these, to fail again in duly employing even this second remedy."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if it be a blame to stand in need of written words, and not to have brought down on ourselves the grace of the Spirit; consider how heavy the charge of not choosing to profit even after this assistance, but rather treating what is written with neglect, as if it were cast forth without purpose, and at random, and so bringing down upon ourselves our punishment with increase."
					},
					{
						"text": "But that no such effect may ensue, let us  give strict heed unto the things that are written; and let us learn how the Old Law was given on the one hand, how on the other the New Covenant."
					},
					{
						"text": "How then was that law given in time past, and when, and where? After the destruction of the Egyptians, in the wilderness, on Mount Sinai, when smoke and fire were rising up out of the mountain, a trumpet sounding, thunders and lightnings, and Moses entering into the very depth of the cloud."
					},
					{
						"text": "But in the new covenant not so,—neither in a wilderness, nor in a mountain, nor with smoke and darkness and cloud and tempest; but at the beginning of the day, in a house, while all were sitting together, with great quietness, all took place."
					},
					{
						"text": "For to those, being more unreasonable, and hard to guide, there was need of outward pomp,as of a wilderness, a mountain, a smoke, a sound of trumpet, and the other like things: but they who were of a higher character, and submissive, and who had risen above mere corporeal imaginations, Yea, for it was removal of punishment, and remission of sins, and \"righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption,\"and adoption, and an inheritance of Heaven, and a relationship unto the Son of God, which he came declaring unto all; to enemies, to the perverse, to them that were sitting in darkness."
					},
					{
						"text": "What then could ever be equal to these good tidings? God on earth, man in Heaven; and all became mingled together, angels joined the choirs of men, men had fellowship with the angels, and with the other powers above: and one might see the long war brought to an end, and reconciliation made between God and our nature,the devil brought to shame, demons in flight, death destroyed, Paradise opened, the curse blotted out, sin put out of the way, error driven off, truth returning, the word of godliness everywhere sown, and flourishing in its growth, the polity of those above planted on the earth, those powers in secure intercourse with us, and on earth angels continually haunting, and hope abundant touching things to come."
					},
					{
						"text": "Therefore he hath called the history good tidings, forasmuch as all other things surely are words only without substance; as, for instance, plenty of wealth, greatness of power, kingdoms, and glories, and honors, and whatever other things among men are accounted to be good: but those which are published by the fishermen would be legitimately and properly called good tidings: not only as being sure and immoveable blessings, and beyond our deserts, but also as being given to us with all facility."
					},
					{
						"text": "For not by laboring and sweating, not by fatigue and suffering, but merely as being beloved of God, we received what we have received."
					},
					{
						"text": "And why can it have been, that when there were so many disciples, two write only from among the apostles, and two from among their followers? (For one that was a disciple of Paul, and another of Peter, together with Matthew and John, wrote the Gospels."
					},
					{
						"text": ") It was because they did nothing for vainglory, but all things for use."
					},
					{
						"text": "\"What then? Was not one evangelist sufficient to tell all?\" One indeed was sufficient; but if there be four that write, not at the same times, nor in the same places, neither after having met together, and conversed one with another, and then they speak all things as it were out of one mouth, this becomes a very great demonstration of the truth."
					},
					{
						"text": "\"But the contrary,\" it may be said, \"hath come to pass, for in many places they are convicted of discordance\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Nay, this very thing is a very great evidence of their truth."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if they had agreed in all things exactly even to time, and place, and to the very words, none of our enemies would have believed but that they had met together, and had written what they wrote by some human compact; because such entire agreement as this cometh not of simplicity."
					},
					{
						"text": "But now even that discordance which seems to exist in little matters delivers them from all suspicion, and speaks clearly in behalf of the character of the writers."
					},
					{
						"text": "But if there be anything touching times or places, which they have related differently, this nothinginjures the truth of what they have said."
					},
					{
						"text": "And these things too, so far as God shall enable us, we will endeavor, as we proceed, to point out; requiring you, together with what we have mentioned, to observe, that in the chief heads, those which constitute our life and furnish outour doctrine, nowhere is any of them found to have disagreed, no not ever so little."
					},
					{
						"text": "But what are these points? Such as follow: That God became man, that He wrought miracles, that He was crucified, that He was buried, that He rose again, that He ascended, that He will judge, that He hath given commandments tending to salvation, that He hath brought in a law not contrary to the Old Testament, that He is a Son, that He is only-begotten, that He is a true Son, that He is of the same substance with the Father, and as many things as are like these; for touching these we shall find that there is in them a full agreement."
					},
					{
						"text": "And if amongst the miracles they have not all of them mentioned all, but one these, the other those, let not this trouble thee."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if on the one hand one had spoken of all, the number of the rest would have been superfluous; and if again all had written fresh things, and different one from another, the proof of their agreement would not have been manifest."
					},
					{
						"text": "For this cause they have both treated of many in common, and each of them hath also received and declared something of his own; that, on the one hand, he might not seem superfluous, and cast on the heapto no purpose; on the other, he might make our test of the truth of their affirmations perfect."
					},
					{
						"text": "Now Luke tells us also the cause wherefore he proceeds to write: \"that thou mayest hold,\" saith he, \"the certainty of the words wherein thou hast been instructed;\"that is, that being continually reminded thou mayest hold to the certainty,and abide in certainty."
					},
					{
						"text": "But as to John, he hath himself kept silence touching the cause; yet,(as a traditionsaith, which hath come down to us from the first, even from the Fathers,) neither did he come to write without purpose; but forasmuch as it had been the care of the three to dwell upon the account of the dispensation,and the doctrines of the Godhead were near being left in silence, he, moved by Christ, then and not till then set himself to compose his Gospel."
					},
					{
						"text": "And this is manifest both from the history itself, and from the opening of his Gospel."
					},
					{
						"text": "For he doth not begin like the rest from beneath, but from above, from the same point, at which he was aiming, and it was with a view to this thathe composed the whole book."
					},
					{
						"text": "And not in the beginning only, but throughout all the Gospel, he is more lofty than the rest."
					},
					{
						"text": "Of Matthew again it is said, that when those who from amongst the Jews had believed came to him, and besought him to leave to them in writing those same things, which he had spoken to them by word, he also composed his Gospel in the language of the Hebrews."
					},
					{
						"text": "And Mark too, in Egypt, is  said to have done this self-same thing at the entreaty of the disciples."
					},
					{
						"text": "For this cause then Matthew, as writing to Hebrews, sought to shew nothing more, than that He was from Abraham, and David; but Luke, as discoursing to all in general, traces up the account higher, going on even to Adam."
					},
					{
						"text": "And the one begins with His generation, because nothing was so soothing to the Jew as to be told that Christ was the offspring of Abraham and David: the other doth not so, but mentions many other things, and then proceeds to the genealogy."
					},
					{
						"text": "But the harmony between them we will establish, both by the whole world, which hath received their statements, and by the very enemies of the truth."
					},
					{
						"text": "For many sects have had birth, since their time, holding opinions opposed to their words; whereof some have received all that they have said, while some have cut off from the rest certain portions of their statements, and so retain them for themselves."
					},
					{
						"text": "But if there were any hostilityin their statements, neither would the sects, who maintain the contrary part, have received all, but only so much as seemed to harmonize with themselves; nor would those, which have parted off a portion, be utterly refuted by that portion; so that the very fragmentscannot be hid, but declare aloud their connexionwith the whole body."
					},
					{
						"text": "And like as if thou shouldest take any part from the side of an animal, even in that part thou wouldest find all the things out of which the whole is composed;—nerves and veins, bones, arteries, and blood, and a sample, as one might say, of the whole lump;—so likewise with regard to the Scriptures; in each portion of what is there stated, one may see the connexion with the whole clearly appearing."
					},
					{
						"text": "Whereas, if they were in discord, neither could this have been pointed out, and the doctrine itself had long since been brought to nought: \"for every kingdom,\" saith He, \"divided against itself shall not stand\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "But now even in this shines forth the might of the Spirit, namely, in that it prevailed on these men, engaged as they were in those things which are more necessary and very urgent, to take no hurt at all from these little matters."
					},
					{
						"text": "Now, where each one was abiding, when he wrote, it is not right for us to affirm very positively."
					},
					{
						"text": "But that they are not opposed to each other, this we will endeavor to prove, throughout the whole work."
					},
					{
						"text": "And thou, in accusing them of disagreement, art doing just the same as if thou wert to insist upon their using the same words and forms of speech."
					},
					{
						"text": "And I do not yet say, that those likewise who glory greatly in rhetoric and philosophy, having many of them written many books touching the same matters, have not merely expressed themselves differently, but have even spoken in opposition to one another (for it is one thing to speak differently and another to speak at variance); none of these things do I say."
					},
					{
						"text": "Far be it from me to frame our defense from the frenzy of those men, neither am I willing out of falsehood to make recommendations for the truth."
					},
					{
						"text": "But this I would be glad to inquire: how were the differing accounts believed? how did they prevail? how was it that, while saying opposite things, they were admired, were believed, were celebrated everywhere in the world?  And yet the witnesses of what they said were many, and many too were the adversaries and enemies thereof."
					},
					{
						"text": "For they did not write these things in one corner and bury them, but everywhere, by sea and by land, they unfolded them in the ears of all, and these things were read in the presence of enemies, even as they are now, and none of the things which they said offended any one."
					},
					{
						"text": "And very naturally, for it was a divine power that pervaded all, and made it to prosper with all men."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if it had not been so, how could the publican, and the fisherman, and the unlearned, have attained to such philosophy? For things, which they that are without have never been able to imagine, no not in a dream, are by these men with great certainty both published and made convincing, and not in their lives only, but even after death: neither to two men, nor twenty men, nor an hundred, nor a thousand, nor ten thousand, but to cities, nations, and people, both to land and sea, in the land both of Greeks and barbarians, both inhabited and desert; and all concerning things far beyond our nature."
					},
					{
						"text": "For leaving the earth, all their discourse is concerning the things in heaven, while they bring in unto us another principle of life, another  manner of living: both wealth and poverty, freedom and slavery, life and death, our world and our polity, all changed."
					},
					{
						"text": "Not like Plato, who composed that ridiculous Republic,or Zeno, or if there be any one else that hath written a polity, or hath framed laws."
					},
					{
						"text": "For indeed, touching all these, it hath been made manifest by themselves, that an evil spirit, and some cruel demon at war with our race, a foe to modesty, and an enemy to good order, oversetting all things, hath made his voice be heard in their soul."
					},
					{
						"text": "When, for example, they make their women common to all, and stripping virgins naked in the Palaestra, bring them into the gaze of men; and when they establish secret marriages, mingling all things together and confounding them, and overturning the limits of nature, what else is there to say? For that these their sayings are all inventions of devils, and contrary to nature, even nature herself would testify, not tolerating what we have mentioned; and this, though they write not amidst persecutions, nor dangers, nor fightings, but in all security and freedom, and deck it out with many ornaments from many sources."
					},
					{
						"text": "But these doctrines of the fishermen, chased as they were, scourged and in jeopardy, both learned and unlearned, both bond and free, both kings and private soldiers, both barbarians and Greeks, have received with all good will."
					},
					{
						"text": "And thou canst not say, that it was because these things were trifling and low, that they were easily to be received by all men: nay, for these doctrines are far higher than those."
					},
					{
						"text": "For as to virginity, they never imagined even the name thereof so much as in a dream, nor yet of voluntary poverty, nor of fasting, nor of any other of those things that are high."
					},
					{
						"text": "But they that are of our part not only exterminate lust, they chastise not only the act, but even an unchaste look, and insulting language, and disorderly laughter, and dress, and gait, and clamor, and they carry on their exactness even to the smallest things, and have filled the whole earth with the plant of virginity."
					},
					{
						"text": "And touching God too, and the things in heaven, they persuade men to be wisewith such knowledge as no one of those hath at any time been able so much as to conceive in his mind."
					},
					{
						"text": "For how could they, who made for gods images of beasts, and of monsters that crawl on the earth, and of other things still more vile?  Yet these high doctrines were both accepted and believed, and they flourish every day and increase; but the others have passed away, and perished, having disappeared more easily than spiders' webs."
					},
					{
						"text": "And very naturally, for they were demons that published these things; wherefore besides their uncleanness, their obscurity is great, and the labor they require greater."
					},
					{
						"text": "For what could be more ridiculous than that \"republic,\"in which, besides what I have mentioned, the philosopher, when he hath spent lines without number, that he may be able to shew what justice is, hath over and above this prolixity filled his discourse with much indistinctness? This, even if it did contain anything profitable, must needs be very useless for the life of man."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if the husbandman and the smith, the builder and the pilot, and every one who subsists by the labor of his hands, is to leave his trade, and his honest toils, and is to spend such and such a number of years in order to learn what justice is; before he has learnt he will often times be absolutely destroyed by hunger, and perish because of this justice, not having learnt anything else useful to be known, and having ended his life by a cruel death."
					},
					{
						"text": "But our lessons are not such; rather Christ hath taughtus what is just, and what is seemly, and what is expedient, and all virtue in general, comprising it in few and plain words: at one time saying that, \"on two commandments hang the Law and the Prophets;\"that is to say, on the love of God and on the love of our neighbor: at another time, \"Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "And these things even to a laborer, and to a servant, and to a widow woman, and to a very child, and to him that appeareth to be exceedingly slow of understanding, are all plain to comprehend and easy to learn."
					},
					{
						"text": "For the lessons of the truth are like this; and the actual result bears witness thereto."
					},
					{
						"text": "All at least have learned what things they are to do, and not learned only, but been emulous also of them; and not in the cities alone nor in the midst of the market places, but also in the summits of the mountains."
					},
					{
						"text": "Yea, for there wilt thou see true wisdomabounding, and choirs of angels shining forth in a human body, and the commonwealthof Heaven manifested here on earth."
					},
					{
						"text": "For a  commonwealthdid these fishermen too write for us, not with commands that it should be embraced from childhood, like those others, nor making it a law that the virtuous man must be so many years old, but addressing their discourse generally to every age."
					},
					{
						"text": "For those lessons are children's toys, but these are the truth of things."
					},
					{
						"text": "And as a place for this their commonwealththey have assigned Heaven, and God they have brought in as the framer thereof, and as lawgiver of the statutes there set; as indeed was their duty."
					},
					{
						"text": "And the rewards in their commonwealthare not leaves of bay nor olive, nor an allowance of meat in the public hall, nor statues of brass, these cold and ordinary things, but a life which hath no end, and to become children of God, to join the angels' choir, and to stand by the royal throne, and to be always with Christ."
					},
					{
						"text": "And the popular guides of this commonwealthare publicans, and fishermen, and tent-makers, not such as have lived for a short time, but such as are now living for ever."
					},
					{
						"text": "Therefore even after their death they may possibly do the greatest good to the governed."
					},
					{
						"text": "This republicis at war not with men, but with devils, and those incorporeal powers."
					},
					{
						"text": "Wherefore also their captain is no one of men, nor of angels, but God Himself."
					},
					{
						"text": "And the armor too of these warriors suits the nature of the warfare, for it is not formed of hides and steel, but of truth and of righteousness, and faith, and all true love of wisdom."
					},
					{
						"text": "Since then the aforesaid republicis both the subject on which this book was written, and it is now proposed for us to speak thereof, let us give careful heed to Matthew, discoursing plainly concerning this: for what he saith is not his own, but all Christ's, who hath made the laws of this city."
					},
					{
						"text": "Let us give heed, I say, that we may be capable of enrolment therein, and of shining forth among those that have already become citizens thereof, and are awaiting those incorruptible crowns."
					},
					{
						"text": "To many, however, this discourse seems to be easy, while the prophetic writings are difficult."
					},
					{
						"text": "But this again is the view of men who know not the depth of the thoughts laid up therein."
					},
					{
						"text": "Wherefore I entreat you to follow us with much diligence, so as to enter into the very ocean of the things written, with Christ for our guide at this our entering in."
					},
					{
						"text": "But in order that the word may be the more easy to learn, we pray and entreat you, as we have done also with respect to the other Scriptures, to take up beforehand that portion of the Scripture which we may be going to explain, that your reading may prepare the way for your understanding (as also was the case with the eunuch), and so may greatly facilitate our task."
					},
					{
						"text": "And this becausethe questions are many and frequent."
					},
					{
						"text": "See, for instance, at once in the beginning of his Gospel, how many difficulties might be raised one after the other."
					},
					{
						"text": "As first, wherefore the genealogy of Joseph is traced, who was not father of Christ."
					},
					{
						"text": "Secondly, whence may it be made manifest that He derives His origin from David, while the forefathers of Mary, who bare Him, are not known, for the Virgin's genealogy is not traced? Thirdly, on what account Joseph's genealogy is traced, when he had nothing to do with the birth; while with regard to the Virgin, who was the very mother, it is not shown of what fathers, or grandfathers, or ancestors, she is sprung."
					},
					{
						"text": "And along with these things, this is also worth inquiry, wherefore it can be, that, when tracing the genealogy through the men, he hath mentioned women also; and why since he determined upon doing this, he yet did not mention them all, but passing over the more eminent, such as Sarah, Rebecca, and as many as are like them, he hath brought forward only them that are famed for some bad thing; as, for instance, if any was a harlot, or an adulteress, or a mother by an unlawful marriage, if any was a stranger or barbarian."
					},
					{
						"text": "For he hath made mention of the wife of Uriah, and of Thamar, and of Rahab, and of Ruth, of whom one was of a strange race, another an harlot, another was defiled by her near kinsman, and with him not in the form of marriage, but by a stolen intercourse, when she had put on herself the mask of an harlot; and touching the wife of Uriah no one is ignorant, by reason of the notoriety of the crime."
					},
					{
						"text": "And yet the evangelist hath passed by all the rest, and inserted in the genealogy these alone."
					},
					{
						"text": "Whereas, if women were to be mentioned, all ought to be so; if not all but some, then those famed in the way of virtue, not for evil deeds."
					},
					{
						"text": "See you how much care is required of us straightway in the first beginning? and yet the beginning seems to be plainer than the rest; to many perhaps even superfluous, as being a mere numbering of names."
					},
					{
						"text": "After this, another point again is worth inquiry; wherefore he hath omitted three kings."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if, because they were exceeding ungodly, he therefore passed by their names in silence, neither should he have mentioned the others, that were like them."
					},
					{
						"text": "And this againis another question; why, after having spoken of fourteen generations, he hath not in the third division maintained the number."
					},
					{
						"text": "And wherefore Luke hath made mention of other names, and not only not all of them the same, but also many more of them, while Matthew hath both fewer and different, though he too hath ended with Joseph, with whom Luke likewise concluded."
					},
					{
						"text": "Ye see how much wakeful attention is needed on our part, not only for explanation, but even that we may learn what things we have to explain."
					},
					{
						"text": "For neither is this a little matter, to be able to find out the difficulties; there being also this other hard point, how Elizabeth, who was of the Levitical tribe, was kinswoman to Mary."
					},
					{
						"text": "But that we may not overload your memory, by stringing many things together, here let us stay our discourse for a time."
					},
					{
						"text": "For it is enough for you in order that ye be thoroughly roused, that you learnthe questions only."
					},
					{
						"text": "But if ye long fortheir solution also, this again depends on yourselves, before we speak."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if I see you thoroughly awakened, and longing to learn, I will endeavor to add the solution also; but if gaping and not attending, I will conceal both the difficulties, and their solution, in obedience to a divine law."
					},
					{
						"text": "For, saith He, \"Give not the holy things to the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "But who is he that tramples them under foot? He that doth not account these things precious, and venerable."
					},
					{
						"text": "And who, it may be asked, is so wretched as not to esteem these things venerable, and more precious than all? He who doth not bestow on them so much leisure as on the harlot women in the theatres of Satan."
					},
					{
						"text": "For there the multitude pass the whole day, and give up not a few of their domestic concerns for the sake of this unseasonable employment, and they retain with exactness whatever they have heard, and this though it be to the injury of their souls, that they keep it."
					},
					{
						"text": "But here, where God is speaking, they will not bear to tarry even a little time."
					},
					{
						"text": "Therefore, let me warn you, we have nothing in common with Heaven, but our citizenshipgoes no further than words."
					},
					{
						"text": "And yet because of this, God hath threatened even hell, not in order to cast us therein, but that He might persuade us to flee this grievous tyranny."
					},
					{
						"text": "But we do the opposite, and run each day the way that leads thither, and while God is commanding us not only to hear, but also to do what He saith, we do not submit so much as to hearken."
					},
					{
						"text": "When then, I pray thee, are we to do what is commanded, and to put our hand to the works, if we do not endure so much as to hear the words that relate to them, but are impatient and restless about the time we stay here, although it be exceedingly short?."
					},
					{
						"text": "And besides, when we are talking of indifferent matters, if we see those that are in company do not attend, we call what they do an insult; but do we consider that we are provoking God, if, while He is discoursing of such things as these, we despise what is said, and look another way?  Why, he that is grown old, and hath travelled over much country, reports to us with all exactness the number of stadia, and the situations of cities, their plans, and their harbors and markets; but we ourselves know not even how far we are from the city that is in Heaven."
					},
					{
						"text": "For surely we should have endeavored to shorten the space, had we known the distance."
					},
					{
						"text": "That city being not only as far from us as Heaven is from the earth, but even much farther, if we be negligent; like as, on the other hand, if we do our best,even in one instant we shall come to the gates thereof."
					},
					{
						"text": "For not by local space, but by moral disposition, are these distances defined."
					},
					{
						"text": "But thou knowest exactly the affairs of the world, as well new as old, and such too as are quite ancient; thou canst number the princes under whom thou hast served in time past, and the ruler of the games, and them that gained the prize, and the leaders of armies, matters that are of no concern to thee; but who hath become ruler in this city, the first or the second or the third, and for how long, each of them; and what each hath accomplished, and brought to pass, thou hast not imagined even as in a dream."
					},
					{
						"text": "And the laws that are set in this city thou wilt not endure to hear, nor attend to them, even when others tell thee of them."
					},
					{
						"text": "How then, I pray thee, dost thou expect to obtain the blessings that are promised, when thou dost not even attend to what is said?."
					},
					{
						"text": "But though never before, now, at any rate, let us do this."
					},
					{
						"text": "Yea, for weare on the point of entering into a city (if God permit) of gold, and more precious than any gold."

Now then, I bid thee transfer these examples to the law likewise; for He that commands to pluck out \"an eye for an eye,\" hath laid the fear as a kind of strong chain upon the souls of the bad, and so resembles him, who detains those assassins in prison; whereas he who appoints no punishment for them, doth all but arm them by such security, and acts the part of that other, who was putting the swords in their hands, and letting them loose over the whole city."

Which is more in extreme, he who exacts a penalty for murder, or for mere anger? He who subjects the adulterer to vengeance after the fact, or he who enjoins a penalty even for the very desire, and that penalty everlasting? See ye not how their reasoning comes round to the very contrary? how the God of the old covenant, whom they call cruel, will be found mild and meek: and He of the new, whom they acknowledged to be good, will be hard and grievous, according to their madness?

					},
					{
						"text": "But to me He seems to be speaking of the judges in this world, and of the way to the court of justice, and of this prison."

Why, the object of our labors is enough to set against all, and our clear persuasion that for God's sake we are enduring all this."

How then shall we behold the kingdom, I pray thee? how shall we set foot on that holy  threshold, who are not surpassing even the publicans?

Thus then, omitting now to speak of the plots to which wealth gives occasion, the strifes, the suits (these indeed He had signified above, when He said, \"The adversary shall deliver thee to the judge, and the judge to the officer\"); and setting down what is more grievous than all these, as sure to occur, He so withdraws us from the wicked desire."

						"text": "For whereas on every occasion He was used to follow the wish of His supplicants, here He rather springs toward it, and offers not only to heal him, but also to come to the house."
					},

					{
						"text": "For if He had not made this offer, but had said, \"Go thy way, let thy servant be healed;\" we should have known none of these things."
					},

					},
					{
						"text": "For being a wise physician and full of resources, He knows how to bring about contraries the one by the other."
					},
					{
						"text": "And as here by His freely-offered coming, so there by His peremptory putting off and denial, He unfolds the woman's faith."

					{
						"text": "For when the centurion had spoken such words, and had testified His so great prerogative; so far from blaming, He did even approve it, and did somewhat more than approve it."
					},
					{
						"text": "For neither hath the evangelist said, that He praised the saying only, but declaring a certain earnestness in His praise, that He even \"marvelled;\" and neither did He simply marvel, but in the presence also of the whole people, and set Him as an example to the rest, that they should emulate Him."
					},
					{
						"text": "Seest thou how each of them that bore witness of His authority is \"marvelled at? And the multitudes were astonished at His doctrine, because He taught as one having authority;\"and so far from blaming them, He both took them with Him when He came down, and by His words of cleansing to the leper, confirmed their judgment."

					},
					{
						"text": "And again, because she had said, \"Whatsoever Thou wilt ask of God, He will give Thee;\" to lead her away from such a surmise, and to teach her that He needs not to receive from another, but is Himself the fountain of all good things, He saith, \"I am the resurrection and the life;\"that is to say, \"I wait not to receive active power,but work all of myself\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Wherefore at the centurion He both marvels, and prefers him to all the people, and honors him with the gift of the kingdom, and provokes the rest to the same zeal."

					},
					{
						"text": "for the instructing of the rest to believe in like manner, listen to the exactness of the evangelist, how he hath intimated it."

					{
						"text": "For,  \"Jesus,\" saith he, \"turned Him about, and said to them that followed Him, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "It follows, that to have high imaginations concerning Him, this especially is of faith, and tends to procure the kingdom and His other blessings."
					},
					{
						"text": "For neither did His praise reach to words only, but He both restored the sick man whole, in recompence of his faith, and weaves for him a glorious crown, and promises great gifts, saying on this wise,  \"Many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down in the bosoms of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out\"."
					},

					{
						"text": "But it is likely, that after sending his friends, he himself also came and said these things."
					},
					{
						"text": "And if Luke did not speak of the one, no more did Matthew of the other; and this is not the part of men disagreeing amongst themselves, but rather of those that are filling up the things omitted by one another."
					},
					{
						"text": "But see by another thing also how Luke hath proclaimed his faith, saying that his servant \"was ready to die\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Nevertheless, not even this cast him into despondency, neither did it cause him to give up: but even so he trusted that he should prevail."
					},
					{
						"text": "And if Matthew affirm Christ to have said, \"I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel,\" and hereby to show clearly that he was not an Israelite; while Luke saith, \"He built our synagogue;\" neither is this a contradiction."
					},
					{
						"text": "For it was possible for one, even though not a Jew, both to build the synagogue, and to love the nation."
					},
					{
						"text": "But do not thou, I pray thee, merely inquire what was said by him, but add thereto his rank also, and then thou wilt see the man's excellency."
					},
					{

					},
					{
						"text": "He, for example, who is set down in John, is for dragging Him unto his house, and saith, \"Come down, for my child is ready to die\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "But not so this man; rather he is far superior both to him, and to those who let down the bed through the roof."
					},
					{
						"text": "For he seeks not for His bodily presence, neither did He bring the sick man near the physician; a thing which implied no mean imaginations concerning Him, but rather a suspicion of His divine dignity."
					},
					{
						"text": "And he saith, \"speak the word only\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "And at the beginning he saith not even, \"speak the word,\" but only describe his affliction: for neither did he, of great humility, expect that Christ would straightway consent, and inquire for his house."
					},
					{
						"text": "Therefore, when he heard Him say, \"I will come and heal him,\" then, not before he saith, \"speak the word\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Nor yet did the suffering confound him, but still under calamity he reasons coolly,not looking so much to the health of the servant, as to the avoiding all appearance of doing anything irreverent."
					},
					{
						"text": "And yet it was not he that pressed it, but Christ that offered it: nevertheless even so he feared, lest perchance he should be thought to be going beyond his own deservings, and to be drawing upon himself a thing above his strength."
					},
					{
						"text": "Seest thou his wisdom? Mark the folly of the Jews, in saying, \"He was worthy for whom He should do the favor\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "For when they should have taken refuge in the love of Jesus towards man, they rather allege this man's worthiness; and know not so much as on what ground to allege it."
					},
					{
						"text": "But not so he, but he affirmed himself even in the utmost degree unworthy, not only of the benefit, but even of receiving the Lord in his house."
					},
					{
						"text": "Wherefore even when he said, \"My servant lieth sick,\" he did not add, \"speak,\" for fear lest he should be unworthy to obtain the gift; but he merely made known his affliction."
					},
					{
						"text": "And when he saw Christ zealous in His turn, not even so did he spring forward, but still continues to keep to the end his own proper measure."
					},
					{
						"text": "And if any one should say, \"wherefore did not Christ honor him in return?\" we would say this, that He did make return to him in honor, and that exceedingly: first by bringing out his mind, which thing chiefly appeared by His not coming to his house; and in the second place, by introducing him into His kingdom, and preferring him to the whole Jewish nation."
					},
					{
						"text": "For because he made himself out unworthy even to receive Christ into his house, he became worthy both of a kingdom, and of attaining unto those good things which Abraham enjoyed."
					},
					{
						"text": "\"But wherefore,\" one may say, \"was not the leper commended, who showed forth things greater than these?\" For he did not so much as say, \"speak the word,\" but what was far more, \"be willing only,\" which is what the prophet saith concerning the Father, \"He hath done whatsoever He pleased\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "But he also was commended."
					},
					{
						"text": "For when He said, \"Offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them,\" He means nothing else but, \"thou shalt be an accuser of them, in that thou didst believe\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "And besides, it was not the same for one that was a Jew to believe, and for one from without that nation."
					},
					{
						"text": "For that the centurion was not a Jew is evident, both from his being a centurion and from its being said, \"I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "And it was a very great thing for a man who was out of the list of the Jewish people to admit so great a thought."
					},
					{
						"text": "For he did no less than imagine to himself, as it seems to me, the armies in Heaven; or that the diseases and death, and everything else, were so subject to Him, as his soldiers to himself."
					},
					{
						"text": "Wherefore he said likewise, \"For I also am a man set under authority;\" that is, Thou art God, and I man; I under authority, but Thou not under authority."
					},
					{
						"text": "If I therefore, being a man, and under authority, can do so much; far more He, both as God, and as not under authority."
					},
					{
						"text": "Thus with the strongest expression he desires to convince Him, that he saith this, as one giving not a similar example, but one far exceeding."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if I (said he), being equal in honor to them whom I command, and under authority, yet by reason of the trifling superiority of my rank am able to do such great things; and no man contradicts me, but what I command, that is done, though the injunctions be various (\"for I say to this man, go, and he goeth; and to another, come, and he cometh\":) much more wilt Thou Thyself be able."
					},
					{
						"text": "And some actually read the place in this way, \"For if I, being a man,\" and having inserted a stop, they add, \"having soldiers under authority under me\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "But mark thou, I pray thee, how he signified that Christ is able both to overcome even death as a slave, and to command it as its master."
					},
					{
						"text": "For in saying, \"come, and he cometh,\" and \"go, and he goeth;\" he expresses this: \"If Thou shouldest command his end not to come upon him, it will not come\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Seest thou how believing he was? For that which was afterwards to be manifest to all, here is one who already hath made it evident; that He hath power both of death and of life, and \"leadeth down to the gates of hell, and bringeth up again\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Nor was he speaking of soldiers only, but also of slaves; which related to a more entire obedience."
					},
					{
						"text": "But nevertheless, though having such great faith, he still accounted himself to be unworthy."
					},
					{
						"text": "Christ however, signifying that he was worthy to have Him enter into his house, did much greater things, marvelling at him, and proclaiming him, and giving more than he had asked."
					},
					{
						"text": "For he came indeed seeking for his servant health of body, but went away, having received a kingdom."
					},
					{
						"text": "Seest thou how the saying had been already fulfilled, \"Seek ye the kingdom of heaven, and all these things shall be added unto you\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "For, because he evinced great faith, and lowliness of mind, He both gave him heaven, and added unto him health."
					},
					{
						"text": "And not by this alone did He honor him, but also by signifying upon whose casting out he is brought in."
					},
					{
						"text": "For now from this time forth He proceeds to make known to all, that salvation is by faith, not by works of the law."
					},
					{
						"text": "And this is why not to Jews only, but to Gentiles also the gift so given shall be proffered, and to the latter rather than to the former."
					},
					{
						"text": "For \"think not,\" saith He, \"by any means, that so it hath come to pass in regard of this man alone; nay, so it shall be in regard of the whole world."
					},
					{
						"text": "And this He said, prophesying of the Gentiles, and suggesting to them good hopes."
					},
					{
						"text": "For in fact there were some following Him from Galilee of the Gentiles."
					},
					{
						"text": "And this He said, on the one hand, not letting the Gentiles despair, on the other, putting down the proud spirits of the Jews."
					},
					{
						"text": "But that His saying might not affrontthe hearers, nor afford them any handle; He neither brings forward prominently what He hath to say of the Gentiles, but upon occasion taken from the centurion; nor doth He use nakedly the term, Gentiles: not saying, \"many of the Gentiles,\" but, \"many from east and west:\"which was the language of one pointing out the Gentiles, but did not so much affront the hearers, because His meaning was under a shadow."
					},
					{
						"text": "Neither in this way only doth He soften the apparent novelty of His doctrine, but also by speaking of \"Abraham's bosom\" instead of \"the kingdom\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "For neither was that term familiar to them:moreover, the introduction of Abraham would be a sharper sting to them."
					},
					{
						"text": "Wherefore John also spake nothing at first concerning hell, but, what was most apt to grieve them, He saith, \"Think not to say, we are children of Abraham\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "He is providing for another point also; not to seem in any sense opposed to the ancient polity."
					},
					{
						"text": "For he that admires the patriarchs, and speaks of their bosom as an inheritance of blessings, doth much more than sufficiently remove also this suspicion."
					},
					{
						"text": "Let no man therefore suppose that the threat is one only, for both the punishment of the one and the joy of the other is double: of the one, not only that they fell away, but that they fell away from their own; of the other, not only that they attained, but that they attained what they had no expectation of: and there is a third together with these, that the one received what pertained to the other."
					},
					{
						"text": "And he calls them \"children of the kingdom,\" for whom the kingdom had been prepared: which also more than all was apt to gall them; in that having pointed to them as being in their bosom by His offer and promise, after all He puts them out."
					},
					{
						"text": "Then, because what He had said was mere affirmation, He confirms it by the miracle; as indeed He shows the miracles in their turn, by the subsequent accomplishment of the prediction."
					},
					{
						"text": "He accordingly, who disbelieves the health which the servant then received, let him from the prophecy, which hath this day come to pass, believe that other also."
					},
					{
						"text": "For so that prophecy again, even before the event, was made manifest to all by the sign which then took place."
					},
					{
						"text": "To this end, you see, having first uttered that prediction, then and not before He raised up the sick of the palsy; that He might make the future credible by the present, and the less by the greater."
					},
					{
						"text": "Since for virtuous men to enjoy His good things, and for the contrary sort to undergo His penalties, were nothing improbable, but a reasonable event, and according to the tenor of laws: but to brace up the feeble, and to raise the dead, was something beyond nature."
					},
					{
						"text": "But nevertheless, unto this great and marvellous work the centurion too contributed no little; which thing, we see, Christ also declared, saying, \"Go thy way, and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Seest thou how the health of the servant proclaimed  aloud both Christ's power, and the faith of the centurion, and also became a pledge of the future? Or rather it was all a proclamation of Christ's power."
					},
					{
						"text": "For not only did He quite heal the servant's body, but the soul also of the centurion He did Himself bring over unto the faith by His miracles."
					},
					{
						"text": "And do thou look not to this only, that the one believed, and the other was healed, but marvel how quickly also."
					},
					{
						"text": "For this too the evangelist declared, saying, \"And his servant was healed in the self-same hour:\" even as of the leper also he said, \"he was straightway cleansed\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "For not by healing, but by doing so both in a wonderful manner and in a moment of time, did He display His power."
					},
					{
						"text": "Neither in this way only doth He profit us, but also by his constant practice, in the manifestation of His miracles, of opening incidentally His discourses about His kingdom, and of drawing all men towards it."
					},
					{
						"text": "For, those even whom He was threatening to cast out, He threatened not in order to cast them out, but in order that through such fear, He might draw them into it by His words."
					},
					{
						"text": "And if not even hereby were they profited, theirs is the whole blame, as also of all who are in the like distemper."
					},
					{
						"text": "For not at all among Jews only may one see this taking place, but also among them that have believed."
					},
					{
						"text": "For Judas too was a child of the kingdom, and it was said to him with the disciples, \"Ye shall sit on twelve thrones;\"yet he became a child of hell; whereas the Ethiopian, barbarian as he was, and of them \"from the east and west,\" shall enjoy the crowns with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob."
					},
					{
						"text": "This takes place among us also now."
					},
					{
						"text": "\"For many,\" saith He, \"that are first shall be last, and the last first\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "And this He saith, that neither the one may grow languid, as unable to return; nor the others be confident, as standing fast."
					},
					{
						"text": "This John also declared before from the beginning, when he said, \"God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Thus, since it was so to come to pass, it is proclaimed long before; that no one may be confounded at the strangeness of the event."
					},
					{
						"text": "But he indeed speaks of it as a possible thing (for he was first); Christ on the other hand as what will surely be, affording the proof of it from His works."
					},
					{
						"text": "Let us not then be confident, who stand, but let us say to ourselves, \"Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall;\"neither let us who are fallen despair, but let us say to ourselves, \"He that falleth, doth he not arise?\" For many even who have mounted to the very summit of Heaven, and have shown forth all austerity, and had made their abode in the deserts, nor saw any woman so much as in a dream; having become a little remiss, have been tripped up, and have come unto the very gulf of wickedness."
					},
					{
						"text": "While others again from thence have gone up to Heaven, and from the stage and orchestra have passed over unto the discipline of angels, and have displayed so great virtue, as to drive away devils, and to work many other such miracles."
					},
					{
						"text": "And of these examples both the Scriptures are full, and our life is also full."
					},
					{
						"text": "Even whoremongers and effeminate persons stop the mouths of the Manichaeans, who say that wickedness is immoveable, enrolling themselves on the devil's side, and weakening the hands of them that would wish to be in earnest, and overturning all our life."
					},
					{
						"text": "For they who inculcate these things, not only injure men as to the future, but here also turn all things upside down, for their own part at least."
					},
					{
						"text": "Because when will any regard virtue, from among those that are living in wickedness, so long as he accounts his return that way, and his change for the better, a thing impossible? For if now, when both laws exist, and penalties are threatened, and there is common opinion to recall the ordinary sort, and hell is looked for, and a kingdom promised, and wrong things reproached, and the good praised; hardly do any choose the labors that are to be undergone for virtue's sake: shouldest thou take away all these things, what is there to hinder ruin and corruption universal?  Knowing therefore the devil's craft, and that as well the lawgivers of the Gentiles as the oracles of God, and the reasonings of nature, and the common opinion of all men, yea barbarians, and Scythians, and Thracians, and generally all, are directly opposed both to these, and to such as strive to enact the doctrines of fate: let us be sober, beloved, and bidding farewell to all those, let us travel along the narrow way, being both confident and in fear: in fear because of the precipices on either side, confident because of Jesus our guide."
					},
					{
						"text": "Let us travel on, sober and wakeful."
					},
					{
						"text": "For though but for a little while one slumber, he is swept away quickly."

						"text": "Yet he arose again quickly."
					},
					{
						"text": "Look not then to his having sinned only, but also to his having washed away his  sin."

					{
						"text": "For to this end He wrote that history, not that thou shouldest behold him fallen, but admire him risen; to teach thee, when thou art fallen, how thou shouldest arise."
					},
					{
						"text": "Thus, as physicians choose out the most grievous diseases, and write them in their books, and teach their method of cure in similar cases; if so be men having practised on the greater, may easily master the less; even so God likewise hath brought forward the greatest of sins, that they also who offend in small things may find the cure of these easy, by means of the other: since if those admitted of healing, much more the less."
					},
					{

					},
					{
						"text": "What then was the manner of his sickness? He committed adultery and murder."
					},
					{
						"text": "For I shrink not from proclaiming these things with a loud voice."
					},

					},
					{
						"text": "Wherefore I not only proclaim it, but I add another circumstance also."

And herein too we should admire the instructivenessof His teaching, that He nailed him fast to His word, and with this freed him from those endless evils, such as lamentations, and mournings, and the things that follow thereafter."

And from many other things too one might perceive, that it is not possible for a disembodied soul to remain here."

					{
						"text": "But for what intent did the devils destroy the swine? Everywhere they have labored to drive men to dismay, and everywhere they rejoice in destruction."
					},

						"text": "This, for instance, the devil did with respect to Job, although in that case too God suffered it, but neither in that case as complying with the devil, but willing to show His own servant the more  glorious, cutting off from the evil spirit all pretext for his shamelessness, and turning on his own head what was done against the righteous man."
					},
					{

					},
					{

Nay, all these bonds he bursts asunder; and if any one come to set him free, he adjures him that he may not be freed, accounting it the greatest torture not to be in torture: than which what can be more wretched? For as to that evil spirit, even though he despised men, yet he yielded to the command of Christ, and quickly sprang out of the man's body; but this man yields not even to His commandment."

Either then one may say this, that the baskets on this last occasionwere greater than those used before,or if this were not so, lest the equality of the miracle should again cast them into forgetfulness, He rouses their recollection by the difference, that by the variation they might be reminded of both one and the other."

For much worse  than these are they that are rich in evil ways, and it is better to beg than to spoil, for the one hath excuse, but the other brings punishment; and the beggar in no degree offends God, but this other both men and God; and undergoes the labors of rapine, but all the enjoyment thereof other men often reap."

Thou hast not yet given as much as she, who cast in the two mites; or rather not so much as the half, nor a very small part of what she gave, but thou layest out the greater part on useless expenses, on banquets, and drunkenness, and extreme extravagance; now bidding, now bidden; now spending, now constraining others to spend; so that the punishment is even rendered twofold for thee, both from what thyself doest, and what thou movest others to do."

But if thou canst not bear to bless him that curses thee, hold thy peace, and accomplish but this for the time; and proceeding in order, and striving as thou oughtest, thou wilt attain to that other point also, and wilt acquire such a mouth, as we have spoken of."

Let us not overlook it, but let us use all diligence, in order to train it to imitate its Lord."

There, gnashing of teeth, and outer darkness, and the fire prepared for the devil, and to be cut asunder, and to be driven away; here, enmities, evil speakings, slanders, perils, cares, plots, to be hated of all, to be abhorred of all, even of the very persons that seem to flatter us."

And how would any be persuaded of it? For as to lust, and anger, and wrath, many impute it even to the temperament of the flesh, and to this do students of medicine refer the excesses thereof; and him that is of a more hot and languid temperament, they affirm to be more lustful; but him that runs out into a drier kind of ill temperament, eager, and irritable, and wrathful."

For if it is for this that riches are an object of desire, if it be in your power to have security without these, what need hast thou of these any more? \"And how is it possible,\" thou sayest, \"for one who is not rich to attain to this?\" Nay, how is it possible (for I say the opposite thing) if one is rich? For it is necessary to flatter many, both rulers and subjects, and to entreat countless numbers, and to be a base slave, and to be in fear and trembling, and to regard with suspicion the eyes of the envious, and to fear the tongues of false accusers, and the desires of other covetous men."
