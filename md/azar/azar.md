#Prayer of Azariah

**[1:1]** And they walked in the midst of the fire, praising God, and blessing the Lord.
**[1:2]** Then Azarias stood up, and prayed on this manner; and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire said,
**[1:3]** Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: thy name is worthy to be praised and glorified for evermore:
**[1:4]** For thou art righteous in all the things that thou hast done to us: yea, true are all thy works, thy ways are right, and all thy judgments truth.
**[1:5]** In all the things that thou hast brought upon us, and upon the holy city of our fathers, even Jerusalem, thou hast executed true judgment: for according to truth and judgment didst thou bring all these things upon us because of our sins.
**[1:6]** For we have sinned and committed iniquity, departing from thee.
**[1:7]** In all things have we trespassed, and not obeyed thy commandments, nor kept them, neither done as thou hast commanded us, that it might go well with us.
**[1:8]** Wherefore all that thou hast brought upon us, and every thing that thou hast done to us, thou hast done in true judgment.
**[1:9]** And thou didst deliver us into the hands of lawless enemies, most hateful forsakers of God, and to an unjust king, and the most wicked in all the world.
**[1:10]** And now we cannot open our mouths, we are become a shame and reproach to thy servants; and to them that worship thee.
**[1:11]** Yet deliver us not up wholly, for thy name’s sake, neither disannul thou thy covenant:
**[1:12]** And cause not thy mercy to depart from us, for thy beloved Abraham’s sake, for thy servant Issac’s sake, and for thy holy Israel’s sake;
**[1:13]** To whom thou hast spoken and promised, that thou wouldest multiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that lieth upon the seashore.
**[1:14]** For we, O Lord, are become less than any nation, and be kept under this day in all the world because of our sins.
**[1:15]** Neither is there at this time prince, or prophet, or leader, or burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place to sacrifice before thee, and to find mercy.
**[1:16]** Nevertheless in a contrite heart and an humble spirit let us be accepted.
**[1:17]** Like as in the burnt offerings of rams and bullocks, and like as in ten thousands of fat lambs: so let our sacrifice be in thy sight this day, and grant that we may wholly go after thee: for they shall not be confounded that put their trust in thee.
**[1:18]** And now we follow thee with all our heart, we fear thee, and seek thy face.
**[1:19]** Put us not to shame: but deal with us after thy lovingkindness, and according to the multitude of thy mercies.
**[1:20]** Deliver us also according to thy marvellous works, and give glory to thy name, O Lord: and let all them that do thy servants hurt be ashamed;
**[1:21]** And let them be confounded in all their power and might, and let their strength be broken;
**[1:22]** And let them know that thou art God, the only God, and glorious over the whole world.
**[1:23]** And the king’s servants, that put them in, ceased not to make the oven hot with rosin, pitch, tow, and small wood;
**[1:24]** So that the flame streamed forth above the furnace forty and nine cubits.
**[1:25]** And it passed through, and burned those Chaldeans it found about the furnace.
**[1:26]** But the angel of the Lord came down into the oven together with Azarias and his fellows, and smote the flame of the fire out of the oven;
**[1:27]** And made the midst of the furnace as it had been a moist whistling wind, so that the fire touched them not at all, neither hurt nor troubled them.
**[1:28]** Then the three, as out of one mouth, praised, glorified, and blessed, God in the furnace, saying,
**[1:29]** Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever.
**[1:30]** And blessed is thy glorious and holy name: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever.
**[1:31]** Blessed art thou in the temple of thine holy glory: and to be praised and glorified above all for ever.
**[1:32]** Blessed art thou that beholdest the depths, and sittest upon the cherubims: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever.
**[1:33]** Blessed art thou on the glorious throne of thy kingdom: and to be praised and glorified above all for ever.
**[1:34]** Blessed art thou in the firmament of heaven: and above all to be praised and glorified for ever.
