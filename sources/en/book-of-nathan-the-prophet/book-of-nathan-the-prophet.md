# The Book of Nathan the Prophet

**[1:0]** Fragment 1: Vision Of The Messiah

**[1:1]** I saw one, a maiden without the touch of a man, with a child in her arms. And that child was the Lord of the Earth, to the ends of the Earth.

**[1:2]** *Variant (The Revelation Of Stephen):* I saw one, a maiden and without touch of man, and a man child in her arms, and that was the Lord of the earth unto the end of the earth.

**[2:0]** Fragment 2: The Last Words Of David

**[2:1]** Keep the commandments of God, O my son Solomon. Study the law of the Lord, walk before him in a perfect heart. God has chosen you, and established you over all the children of Israel.

**[2:2]** Execute the justice I did not do all these forty years. I admonish you, O my son Solomon, carry out my will, and remember the mystery of YHWH that I saw in a vision of wonders from the Lord of the universe, about his virgin mother, who will emerge from our tribe. I pray that he gives mercy to me and all his creatures in the world.

**[2:3]** And David told all this to his son Solomon. He stopped talking, and died a good old age. Solomon gave him a dignified burial, near his fathers, and rendered thanks to God, to whom we owe thanksgiving and praise unceasingly and eternally.

**[3:0]** Fragment 3: Origin of The Ascent Psalms

**[3:1]** When I realized that they had debated for too long, I told them this is unsatisfactory. So we will all go together to the Tabernacle of the Lord, we will assemble the degrees of the altar, and to whom the spirit of God descends, will tell us the order of the Book of Psalms.

**[3:2]** Everyone accepted this condition, so we went to the Tabernacle of the Lord. The son of Korah climbed the first degrees to the altar and spoke. But they did not say a word, and he stepped down.

**[3:3]** Asaph went in turn, and the Spirit of God descended upon him, convicting him, that neither he nor the son of Korah should complete this task.

**[3:4]** Then I went, and the spirit of God descended upon me, and never left me. Until the point that I had the ends, and the recitation formulas for each of the fifteen degrees.

**[3:5]** The crowd cried with one voice, This prophecy must be attributed to David, and it is for him to write it. And I said No, each one should write each of his Psalms in his own name.

**[3:6]** And he (the son of Korah) fled to his own house because of what I said. Then I got up, and I went to the mountain. I fasted and I spoke to God with humble prayers.

**[3:7]** And He came to me and gave me all the prophecies which reveal the coming of Messiah. I wrote them down in this volume, and placed it in my library which is in the Capitol.
