# Synopsis
## Mentioned in the Bible

This partially lost work was seemingly preserved along with other works, by the Cochin Jews of India. Part of the lost five books of the prophets, with The Book Of Gad The Seer, The Book Of Nathan The Prophet is one of two of the unique books from the Cochin Jews broader canon published in English. Sadly, only three fragments are known, with vague origins.

### Discovery by Ken Johnson Th.D.

The fragments were uncovered by Ken Johnson Th.D., and have not been published. However, he did read from them, and the following fragments are the ones he presented from verbatim. As well, Johnson did give details on the rest of the text:

- The book was divided into five sections: Prophecy, Doctrine, History, Psalms, and a part dedicated to the Temple of Solomon.
- It had Psalms 51, and 120-134 along with it.
- It contained sermons attributed to David.
- It contained a story of the restoration of the Ark Of The Covenant, after being stolen by the Philistines, an account of Nathan’s family being killed by King Saul, and an expanded narrative on the sin of King David with Bathsheba.

### Medieval References

Aside from this, a Medieval Romance dubbed the Revelation Of Stephen, quotes from “Nathan The Prophet.” This quote is nearly identical to the first fragment discovered by Johnson. Also, there is evidence that the second was also discovered by another, and the details told of it having been a fragment written in French. Finally, there is a legend in an ancient document called the Lives Of The Prophets, which told a legend, identical to the final detail mentioned by Ken Johnson.

### Canonicity

While it is likely the ancient Jewish people used this work often as scripture, it became lost to the scattered nation. Currently, only the Cochin Jews of India own this text, and according to Johnson, view these works as taboo, because of Christian-like themes.


## More on Nathan the Prophet

### Nathan

He, David's prophet, was from Gibeon, of a Hivite clan. It was he who taught the king the law of the Lord. He foresaw David's sin with Bathsheba, and set out in haste to warn him, but Satan (“Beliar”) thwarted his attempt. He found lying by the road the naked body of a man who had been slain; and while he was detained by this duty, he knew that in that night the king had committed the sin; so he turned back to Gibeon in sorrow. Then when David caused the death of Bathsheba’s husband, the Lord sent Nathan to convict him. He lived to an advanced old age, and when he died he was buried in his own land.
